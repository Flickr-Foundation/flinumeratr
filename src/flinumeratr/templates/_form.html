      I considered adding a `pattern` and `title` attribute here [1],
      which would only allow users to enter flickr.com URLs.

      I decided against it for now because I'm not a massive of the
      in-browser alerts explaining what's wrong -- I think we can do
      a better job letting users submit a non-Flickr URL and showing
      our error flow.

    {#
      The effect of this line is to prepend 'https://' to the start of
      the URL if the user has entered something that starts with 'flickr.com'
      but isn't a full URL -- the `type="url"` is quite strict about needing
      a protocol here.

      (Alternatively, we could get rid of `type="url"`, but I like that for
       the small UX improvement on mobile.)
