      The effect of this line is to prepend 'https://' to the start of
      the URL if the user has entered something that starts with 'flickr.com'
      but isn't a full URL -- the `type="url"` is quite strict about needing
      a protocol here.

      (Alternatively, we could get rid of `type="url"`, but I like that for
       the small UX improvement on mobile.)
