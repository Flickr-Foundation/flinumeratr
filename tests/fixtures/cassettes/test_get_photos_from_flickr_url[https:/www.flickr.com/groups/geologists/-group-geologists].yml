      made it to the relative saftety of the sidewalk. Looking up Clark Street, at
      the building&#039;s northern half.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nFor my current book-writing
      project, &lt;i&gt;Chicago Suburbs in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;, I&#039;ve been
      reviewing for the umpteenth time the surprisingly abundant geologic literature
      on the sand-and-gravel spits that now form low ridges in the city, the North
      Shore, and Oak Park and Forest Park areas. \n\nThis foray into spitology reminded
      me that North Clark and its unusual northwest-southeast trend is the result
      of its being the crest of the Graceland Spit. This landform, named for the graveyard
      I feature prominently in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670513&quot;&gt;my
      &lt;i&gt;Cemetery Science&lt;/i&gt; album&lt;/a&gt;, was built in the nearshore
      waters of Lake Chicago about 5.5 ka ago. \n\nIn previous shots of this series,
      I&#039;ve described the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company cladding, formed from
      Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) clays mined in the Illinois Basin, that
      adorns the lower portion of this storage warehouse. Here it is at much closer
      range.\n\nOf course the most eye-catching item is the olive-skinned representation
      of one of the original Reebie Brothers decked out as Ramses II. His sibling
      is an identical Ramses II, out of sight on the other side of the entrance. \n\nBut
      the rest of the building&#039;s face is a nice assortment of botanical references,
      especially to &lt;i&gt;Nymphaea lotus&lt;/i&gt;, the Egyptian Lotus. This aquatic
      plant was to the ancients a potent symbol of death and resurrection. Its flower
      buds emerge and rise above the waters of the Nile and open by day, then close
      and submerge again at night, and reemerge the following day.\n\nThe Egyptian
      Lotus is present here both in closed-bud and opened-flower forms. And there
      are also palm-leaf motifs in the capitals of the squat columns. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For

      height_l=\"768\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Taken from the
      roof of the Natural Bridge, a little farther across the span than the &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53271012034/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      5&lt;/a&gt; location.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nHere we&#039;re looking at the gap between
      the Bridge and the bluff. I especially like this shot because it shows a good
      uniformitarian process: water, that great and patient eroder, flows over the
      lip of the cliff. Year after year, decade after decade, century after century,
      little spring-freshet streams like this gradually widen what was once a narrow
      &lt;i&gt;joint&lt;/i&gt;\u2014a fracture in bedrock where no appreciative displacement
      has occurred between the two sides. \n\nAnd in this case, what was once part
      of the cliff eventually became a detached slice of rock, hollowed out below
      when the water hit a shale layer and had to move outward rather than farther
      downward.\n\nThis water and rock are also the basis of all the green communities,
      algal films to tall-growing vascular plants, than live atop and on the sides
      of the exposed Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) Pounds Sandstone. Any geologist
      who is not also enraptured by the biota, and any biologist blind to the geology,
      are missing the essential fusion of things that makes all divisions of scientific
      study artificial constructions. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this beautiful and
      geologically fascinating locale, get a copy of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Geology

      the view is from the porch on the building&#039;s eastern side.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nHere
      there&#039;s plenty of what I take to be Regional Silurian Dolostone from Wauwatosa,
      or some other source near Milwaukee. But in this description I focus instead
      on the stout, polished column shafts.\n\nAs I noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53267563072/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      11&lt;/a&gt;, the shafts were fashioned from blocks of Montello Granite, an
      igneous intrusive rock with a mineralogical composition that is reputedly up
      to 40 percent quartz. This means that the effort it took to cut, shape, and
      polish this stone was much greater than it would have been to process competing
      granite varieties. One example of this: whereas a cutting wire works through
      about 4 ft (1.2 m) of normal granite per hour; the same device only makes it
      through 8 in (0.2 m) of the Montello in the same amount of time. \n\nNaturally,
      this drove up the latter&#039;s price\u2014as did the fact that only about 10
      percent of the rock extracted at the Montello, Wisconsin quarry was deemed suitable
      for architectural or monumental use.\n\nClassed as an alkali-feldspar granite,
      the Montello has been dated to about 1.75 Ga in the Paleoproterozoic era. This
      is interesting, given that that timeframe lies about 100 Ma after the Penokean
      Orogeny and about 50 Ma before the Yavapai Orogeny. Such crust-crunching, mountain-building
      events are thought to be a main source of granite-pluton production. But this
      sort of activity was noticeably absent in Wisconsin at 1.75 Ga. \n\nHowever,
      alkali-feldspar granites are thought to often originate in a different way,
      in extensional environments\u2014where the crust is being pulled, thinned, and
      rifted. So perhaps that was the case when the bodies of magma that formed the
      Montello and associated extrusive rhyolites rose from the lower crust. One mechanism
      that causes such extension is called &lt;i&gt;slab rollback&lt;/i&gt;. It occurs
      when subducting oceanic crust steepens its angle and causes the adjacent continental
      margin to stretch. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of

      from what was then a nice bed of hybrid tea roses toward the temple&#039;s eastern
      and northern elevations.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nPaestum&#039;s three splendid Doric temples
      are largely constructed with a rock type I informally call the Paestum Travertine.
      It should not be confused with the much more famous and much more widely utilized
      Tivoli Travertine quarried far to the north, in the Acque Albule region west
      of Rome (and found in some abundance even on modern buildings in my barbarian
      Trans-Atlantic region). \n\nThe Paestum rock type, like the Tivoli, derives
      from a carbonate deposit formed from calcium-rich water. In this case, the water
      source was the nearby Capodifiume springs, which from the Pleistocene epoch
      to the present have apparently built out this site&#039;s surrounding coastal
      plain quite significantly. \n\nAnother Quaternary-period building material found
      on the First Temple of Hera is a very young clastic rock, taken from  Holocene
      dune ridges, which I identify as the Paestum Sandstone. It was used on the structure&#039;s
      upper portions, particularly the metopes.\n\nBoth of these locally quarried
      selections are probably endemic to this archaeological site. But they certainly
      have withstood the test of time to a remarkable degree.\n\nPhotos and descriptions
      of Hera&#039;s Second Temple, and of Athena&#039;s only one, will follow. \n\n\n

      height_l=\"920\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Looking at the
      central and eastern portions of the building&#039;s facade (southern elevation).
      &lt;/i&gt;\n\nI keep trying to put all of its design elements together in my
      mind as some sort of coherent whole, but can never quite make it. Still, from
      a geological standpoint, Old City Hall is certainly a fascinating farrago of
      different materials one can scrutinize as though they&#039;re their own separate
      entities floating free of one another.\n\nFirst, of course, is all that terrific,
      maroon-and-mottled rock. It&#039;s locally quarried Jacobsville Sandstone, which
      was deposited atop the great mafic lava outpourings of the Midcontinent Rift
      (MCR). The rifting event itself was possibly caused by a rare combination of
      two separate events:\n\n- Crustal thinning and extension caused by the separation
      of Laurentia (ancestral North America) from Amazonia, and\n\n- This part of
      Laurentia passing over a mantle plume.\n\nWhile the eruptive phase of the MCR
      is constrained quite nicely to ca. 1.1 Ga (Upper Mesoproterozoic era), it&#039;s
      not known for sure how long afterward the Jacobsville was deposited. Estimates
      have ranged from &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; late Mesoproterozoic to early Cambrian,
      an uncomfortably long span of about 500 Ma. Unfortunately this rock type lacks
      index fossils and other diagnostic features geochronologists rely on.\n\nThe
      Jacobsville is complemented by a lot of lighter-toned Marquette Brick, another
      buillding material produced in this locale. I&#039;ve discussed it a bit more
      fully in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53205525427/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      21 of this set&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nAnd while I can find no proof of this yet, I&#039;m
      guessing the porch&#039;s column shafts are Montello Granite, the red, quartz-saturated
      igneous rock from the town of that name in Wisconsin. It&#039;s also possible
      that it&#039;s the Peterhead variety of Scotland&#039;s Aberdeenshire Granite.
      But by the 1890s most courthouse and town-hall architects in the Upper Midwest
      were using the domestically produced Montello. \n\nClose-ups of the facade will
      follow. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this series,

      9&lt;/a&gt; locale, along the trail leading to the mouth of Boquillas Canyon.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAt
      this point it&#039;s clear that I suffer from Hechtexiomania, the condition
      of being  too emotionally invested in &lt;i&gt;Hechtia texensis&lt;/i&gt;. This
      member of the Pineapple Family (Bromeliaceae) has adapted itself to Big Bend&#039;s
      parched and infernal Chihuahuan Desert conditions. Wherever I found it in the
      park, I photographed it and marveled at its affinity for living in cracks and
      crevices of Cretaceous-limestone outcrops, as here.\n\nUnlike the plants shown
      in the previous shot, this individual was not in flower. But it does display
      the salient characteristics of its narrow, sharply toothed leaves. Those lower
      in the rosette are flushed deep red; the upper ones show the silvery scales
      that are, I assume, a moisture-retaining adaptation. \n\nWhile as noted in earlier
      descriptions I roundly dislike this species&#039;s common name, False Agave,
      I have to admit that the plant often does have a more regularly radial, agave-ish
      habit. But here the foliage is quite inrolled and contorted, to the point it
      almost seems to belong to a &lt;i&gt;Tillandsia&lt;/i&gt; &amp;quot;air plant&amp;quot;
      instead. But, dagnabbit, &lt;i&gt;H. texensis&lt;/i&gt; this specimen surely
      is.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this set and my

      toward the monumental, slot-in-the-hill entrance to this tholos, which is also
      known as the &amp;quot;Tomb of Agamemnon.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; \n\n&lt;b&gt;Behold
      Bronze Age Building Skills at Their Boldest! \nStonework on Steroids! Colossal
      Chunks of Conglomerate! Amazing Ashlar! Massive Masonry! Lovely Lithic Artistry!
      Petrologic Perfection!&lt;/b&gt;\n\nNow that I&#039;ve gotten that disturbing
      alliterative outburst out of my system, let me identify the stone a little more
      precisely as the coarse-textured clastic sedimentary rock I informally call
      the Mycenae Conglomerate. Pliocene to Pleistocene in age, it was quarried on
      the floor of the Argos Graben nearby. It&#039;s also seen extensively in &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52322614536/in/album-72177720303812060/&quot;&gt;the
      walls of Mycenae&#039;s citadel&lt;/a&gt;, just 0.4 km (0.25 mi) to the northeast.
      \n\nI&#039;ve come across various accounts of fancier stone types that were
      originally used to adorn this beehive tomb. I&#039;ll discuss one or two of
      them in the following photo&#039;s description. \n\nHere, however, it&#039;s
      worth noting that at least one reference mentions that the front exterior was
      clad in some sort of &amp;quot;marble&amp;quot; from the southern part of the
      Peloponnese. Whether this was the striking green Krokees Porphyry (known in
      Italian stonemason lingo as the &amp;quot;Porfido verde antico&amp;quot;), I&#039;m
      not sure. Greece is so rich in nifty rock types that one has only to walk about
      fourteen paces from an outcrop of one variety to find yet another. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      so this is the western elevation. This site is situated in the Plaka, in a narrow
      defile on the northern flank of the Acropolis.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nSources I&#039;ve
      come across describe this church&#039;s subsequent modifications in less than
      admiring terms. And indeed, its facade seems to have been redone by the local
      equivalent of the Impromptu Fixit Company, employing a decidedly sloppy and
      randomized style quite alien to the meticulous artistry of  Middle Byzantine
      masons. \n\nI&#039;m not sure if all that rubble stone now adorning the front
      is the standard &lt;i&gt;poros&lt;/i&gt;\u2014marly Pliocene limestone quarried
      in Piraeus and Megara. But it looks as though the ashlar of the lovely and better-preserved
      Athenian-style dome is in fact the genuine article. \n\nAlso preserved in the
      dome&#039;s drum is the standard cloisonn\xE9 masonry technique, where the blocks
      of the pitted, fosiliferous carbonate rock are separated with thin red brick.
      And speaking of brick: there&#039;s all that characteristic archwork in that
      medium, too.  \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this

      we can&#039;t really discern the subtle, fine-grained texture of the Permian-period
      Narragansett Pier Granite used throughout this lofty and ornate monument.  But
      we do have a much finer view of the three allegorical female figures perched
      on its upper surfaces.\n\nWhen it comes to this ensemble of symbol-laden ladies,
      the old salt in me feels an instinctive preference for the one clutching an
      anchor. But of course the most dramatic of the bunch is the standing and more
      fully illuminated woman gesturing heavenward. Note the cross she carries in
      her left hand. It&#039;s festooned with Easter Lilies (&lt;i&gt;Lilium longiflorum&lt;/i&gt;),
      plants that have long served as a Christian emblem of the Resurrection.  \n\nThe
      graveyard botany doesn&#039;t stop there, however. As noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53250733547/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      previous photo of this set&lt;/a&gt;, the rich green foliage of a mature Red
      Oak (&lt;i&gt;Quercus rubra&lt;/i&gt;) provides an effective backdrop. \n\nFor
      more on the geologic origins of the Narragansett Pier, click the Part 14 link
      in the preceding paragraph. Subsequent close-ups of this stone will reveal its
      mineralogical makeup.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To learn much more about this site and 200

      the rocky debris on the floor of the intermittent Blue Creek, in Tuff Canyon.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIn
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53249755023/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      previous photo of this series&lt;/a&gt; I pointed out what I think is a &lt;i&gt;lahar&lt;/i&gt;
      (volcanic mudflow) deposit in the canyon&#039;s lower wall. And I surmise that
      the detached chunk of stone shown here may have come from such a bed.\n\nI was
      once told by some instructor or fellow geologist that lahars can often be identified
      by a greater density of large rock fragments than is normally found in air falls
      found adjacent to them. This makes eminent sense to me, given the considerable
      hefting power of a mudflow coursing down a slope or stream channel. But in this
      case I stand ready to be corrected by anyone with a better grasp of igneous
      petrology and lithology than I. Alas, I was born in Illinois, not Iceland.\n\nAt
      any rate, this boulder, whose true size is indicated by the Sharpie pen artfully
      placed atop it for scale, is worthy of a little scrutiny. Whether it originated
      in a lahar flow or not, there&#039;s no doubting that it&#039;s a &lt;i&gt;breccia&lt;/i&gt;
      rather than a plain old conglomerate. This because its clasts (component rock
      fragments) are mostly angular rather than quite rounded. \n\nThe darkest of
      its fragments are almost certainly Oligocene-epoch Bee Mountain Basalt, the
      unit also found cropping out at the base of the canyon cliffs. The gray to olive-weathering
      chunks may be another lava type, trachyandesite, or possibly ash-fall tuff.\n\nSome
      of the other, smaller rocks in this shot appear to be porphyritic specimens
      of various igneous types, with larger crystals (&lt;i&gt;phenocrysts&lt;/i&gt;)
      set in a much finer groundmass. And there are some notable lumps of black and
      apparently aphanitic basalt. \n\n&lt;b&gt;My other photos and descriptions in

      wee portion of the building&#039;s western elevation. At last I&#039;ve made
      direct tactile contact with this famous Prairie School edifice.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nArchitect
      Frank Lloyd Wright, who had a penchant for designing really snazzy Nineteen-Fifties
      houses in the Nineteen-Aughts, here chose a premium-quality building material
      manufactured to his exacting specifications, in what was then the Midwest&#039;s
      greatest brick production center: St. Louis, Missouri. In fact, FLW actually
      traveled to that great river city, no doubt at Mr. Robie&#039;s expense, to
      make sure he got exactly what he wanted. \n\nAnd what he wanted was long-and-low
      Roman Brick that measured 11-5/8 x 4 x 1-5/8 in (29.5 x 10.2 x 4.1 cm) and featured,
      in addition to its rich-red base color, copious silver-gray flecking. The latter
      was produced by firing the bricks at an especially high kiln temperature that
      encouraged their clay&#039;s   iron content to migrate to the surface and congeal
      there.   \n\nClay for common-variety St. Louis Brick came from the city&#039;s
      abundant Pleistocene-epoch deposits of &lt;i&gt;loess&lt;/i&gt; (windblown,
      glacially derived silt) that mantles the Mississippi River bluff. However, facing-quality
      brick such as the Robie&#039;s was made from the Cheltenham Clay, a Pennsylvanian-subperiod
      (Upper Carboniferous) coal-swamp underclay (&lt;i&gt;paleosol&lt;/i&gt;, or
      ancient soil) mined in shafts under the city.       \n\nOnce this special consignment
      of Roman, St. Louis, iron-flecked bricks arrived on site, Wright directed his
      masons to lay them in two different mortars: \n\n- a normal buff-colored type
      for the horizontal joints, carefully raked out to enhance shadowing, and \n\n-
      a red mixture for the vertical joints that blended so well with the brick itself
      that even from a close distance the viewer sees not individual units of fired
      clay but continuous stripes, akin to the flat-lying sedimentary strata of  northern
      Illinois and southern Wisconsin.\n\nThe result of all is that the Robie House&#039;s
      profound sense of horizontality is intensified even more. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For much
      more on this site and 200 others in the Windy City, see my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago
      in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;, described at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..&quot;

      at the main portal, situated at the northwestern corner of this church-turned-museum.&lt;/i&gt;
      \n\nAs I noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53187912844/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      21 of this series&lt;/a&gt;, I&#039;m not sure whether this elaborately ornamented,
      Gothic-style pointed archway is a later add-on, but I assume it is, for reasons
      already discussed in the earlier description. At any rate, the amount of carved
      detail in what I take to be the Segovia Sandstone is impressive and fascinating
      to scrutinize.\n\nRegarding the angelic painting of the tympanum, I can&#039;t
      quite tell from modern imagery whether it&#039;s still there. To my untutored
      eye, its seraphim (?) fluttering about the Godhead certainly look Romanesque
      or Gothic, or at least Romanesque-ish or Gothic-ish.\n\nThe Segovia Sandstone
      that gives San Juan and the city&#039;s later churches such a distinctive look
      dates to the waning phase of the Cretaceous period. Having just digested a hefty
      compendium of technical papers on the stratigraphy and tectonic history of Spain,
      I can say that this handsome golden-toned rock unit was deposited on the flank
      of the Iberian Peninsula&#039;s Central Range, which includes the nearby Guadarrama
      Mountains. \n\nThe Central Range is largely composed of granitoid plutons injected
      into the upper crust during the end-of-the-Paleozoic Variscan Orogeny. This
      enduring igneous rock, including the Guadarrama Granite visible today in &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52875633471/in/album-72177720307451632/&quot;&gt;the
      Segovia Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt;, was subsequently uplifted during the next crust-compressing,
      mountain-building episode, the Alpine Orogeny, which began in the Upper Cretaceous.
      \  \n\nAt about the same time, the Segovia Sandstone came into being as part
      of a transgressive sequence of shallow-water (intertidal to lagoonal) sedimentary
      strata deposited on a carbonate platform. These strata also included limestone
      and dolostone. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this

      section of the facade (western elevation).&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIn this final shot of
      the Dodge House, I&#039;ve chosen one spot on the exterior that is quite representative
      of all of the cobblework. I&#039;m not sure why, but I find the not-so-simple
      artfulness of the place mesmerizing.\n\nI think it&#039;s the combination of
      the stones, so carefully segregated by geologic type, and the little mortar
      boxes that hold them as though they&#039;re accessioned museum specimens lying
      in a cabinet tray. There are the black Mesoproterozoic basalts, emissaries from
      the cataclysmic Midcontinent Rift event; the even older pink and gray granitoids
      of North America&#039;s ancient core; the Silurian dolostones, at 425 Ma the
      youngsters of the lot.   \n\nIf you peer at these long enough, you&#039;ll sense
      that for all their implied tidiness there&#039;s actually a lot of tomfoolery
      going on. One sees this in the relentless regularity of various irregularities:
      in the differing thicknesses of dark, medium, and light bands, and in what angle
      the cobbles of each course are set. \n\nAny attempt to find a grand repeating
      pattern leads to madness. However meticulous the Dodges meant to be, they expressed
      something quite amazingly subconscious, a kind of architectural Ouija-board
      message in letters of stone. But to understand exactly what I mean by this,
      you really have to see the place for yourself. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To peruse the other

      &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53237534859/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      11&lt;/a&gt;, displays my lack of good sense in that it was taken in the middle
      of North Clark Street, a place where absentminded photographic pedestrians normally
      should not stand.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhile the viewer&#039;s eye is naturally drawn
      to all that sumptuous, Egyptianate terra-cotta on the ground floor (and in those
      snazzy window surrounds on the second level as well), I now focus on the much
      plainer upper facade. In future shots of this series I&#039;ll return to the
      Northwestern Terra Cotta Company artistry below\u2014including the arrestingly
      olive-green pharaohs that flank the main entrance.\n\nThe reason the stuff above
      is worthy of mention is that it is, unless I&#039;m cruelly mistaken, white
      &lt;i&gt;glazed&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;enameled brick&lt;/i&gt;. These types
      of glossy-coated bricking are venerable forms of architectural ornamentation
      in their own right. \n\nThe glazed  variety was used at least as far back as
      the ancient Babylonians (e. g., in their city&#039;s magnificent Ishtar Gate,
      of the sixth century BC). The enameled kind, on the other hand, was pioneered
      in the American Middle West by the Tiffany Company of Momence, Illinois. At
      first it was used primarily for interior hallways, bathrooms, and to provide
      highly reflective walls for office-building light wells. But then it caught
      on, at just about the beginning of the twentieth century, as decorative facade
      cladding, too.\n\nWhether the bricks here are enameled (with the outer coating
      agent fused by very high kiln heat into the brick itself) or just glazed (with
      an unfused coat that sits outside the brick), they&#039;re remarkably like architectural
      terra-cotta in their ability to be washed and maintained easily.\n\nAnother
      bit of interest in the Reebie Warehouse&#039;s glazed or enameled bricks is
      that they&#039;re set in a pattern known as &lt;i&gt;running bond&lt;/i&gt;.
      In this arrangement, one of the most frequently used by masons, all the bricks
      are set as &lt;i&gt;stretchers&lt;/i&gt; (with their long sides exposed to view).
      And each stretcher of one course (row) is centered directly above the joint
      between two stretchers of the course directly below.\n\nIn many other bonds,
      &lt;i&gt;headers&lt;/i&gt; (short brick ends) also make an appearance in one
      way or another. But the running bond, as you can see here, is absolutely headerless.
      \n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this site, see my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago in Stone and

      perspective, it&#039;s one thing to walk around the narrow roof of the Natural
      Bridge when all alone, and quite another to herd a gaggle of tour participants
      across it. Half of the group are birdwatchers obsessed with a chickadee on a
      distant tree branch; the others are the daredevil type too damned curious about
      what lies over the edge. A misdirected step and unintended nose-dive into the
      boulders below are all too imaginable.\n\nBut then it&#039;s time for the guide
      to do some diaphragmatic breathing, and just relax. After all, everyone is enjoying
      the lovely spring day, and overtly grateful that you&#039;ve brought them here.
      And besides, they&#039;ve all signed waivers releasing you from personal liability.\n\nAs
      it turns out, those waivers were probably not worth the paper they were printed
      on. Still, here you are years later, basking in the memory that you lost no
      one and killed no one and didn&#039;t even have a single sprained ankle on all
      of those trips to darken your name.\n\nAnd now, peering at this one moment frozen
      in time, you can turn your attention to an appreciation of nature shorn of all
      responsibility. You can meditate on the old fork-trunked ash tree, the same
      one shown from below in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/&quot;&gt;Part
      1&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can ponder the moss-and-lichen-dappled Pounds Sandstone,
      which 320 Ma before had been a stream deposit in another, much earlier bedrock
      canyon.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this beautiful and geologically fascinating
      locale, get a copy of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Geology

      height_l=\"768\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Looking northwestward
      toward one section of the courthouse&#039;s eastern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis
      portion of this Richardsonian Romanesque building reminds me powerfully of the
      arcaded porches of the original version of the Romanesque style, as articulated
      in the churches of Segovia, Spain. Here&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53042100663/in/album-72177720307451632/&quot;&gt;one
      example of that&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nThe three main exterior building materials, all
      products of Wisconsin, are visible in this shot, though the richly red Maiden
      Rock Brick here takes a back seat to the great mass of Regional Silurian Dolostone.
      Note the striking checkerboard masonry of widely spaced ashlar blocks under
      the columns. It almost looks like a wind baffle. At any rate, the masons who
      set the stone must have had tremendous fun with all the different patterns they
      got to play with.  \n\nAs I noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53212741652/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      Part 10 description&lt;/a&gt;, I&#039;m guessing that the buff-to-buttery-yellow
      ashlar is specifically Wauwatosa Dolostone, quarried in the Menomonee River
      Valley just west of Milwaukee. If it isn&#039;t, though, it comes from another
      locality in the eastern portion of the Badger State.\n\nAnd then there are those
      beautiful gleaming column shafts of Montello Granite. This intrusive igneous
      rock was a costly and  premium-grade selection. Paleoproterozoic in age, it
      has an unusually high quartz content that made it devilishly difficult to cut,
      shape, and polish. But when all that extra effort was taken, the result was
      what may well be the most enduring of all building and monumental stones. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      Taken from the palace&#039;s entrance.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThroughout this set showing
      this splendid building in its former ruinous state, I have made reference to
      a flock of free-range chickens who accompanied me on my exploration of this
      roofless hulk. \n\nHere, at long last, they make an appearance, pecking away
      in the middle ground. And to their left, there&#039;s also a free-range rooster
      perched on the lowest course of ashlar of the Blachernae Walls. He looks like
      a road-crew foreman, standing around idly and telling everyone else what to
      do.\n\nIf you now visit the fully restored building, which serves as the Tekfur
      Saray\u0131 Museum, you probably won&#039;t have fine feathered tour guides.
      But you&#039;ll still behold all that lovely Late Byzantine masonry, with its
      combination of locally quarried, Miocene Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone and contrasting
      belt courses of red brick. To see it at its best, at least as I saw it half
      a century ago, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53116995519/in/album-72177720303792872/&quot;&gt;Part
      1&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nAnd I should also note that the column appearing as a dark
      silhouette in this frame still stands, along with one other. From more modern
      imagery I gather their shafts at least are handsome, veined Proconnesian Marble.
      That premium building material of the emperors and sultans was quarried on Marmara
      Island, in the Sea of Marmara, about 115 km (ca. 70 mi) to the southwest of
      here. \n\nThe Proconnesian&#039;s &lt;i&gt;protolith&lt;/i&gt; (original, unmetamorphosed
      rock type) was limestone laid down in the Precambrian or early Paleozoic era.
      Much later, it was transformed into its present form in the Permian period,
      during the Variscan Orogeny. For what it&#039;s worth, that far-ranging mountain-building
      event also triggered the emplacement of various bodies of granitic magma in
      what is now the northern part of the Mediterranean Basin\u2014 including that
      which ultimately supplied the Romans with the stone for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52813376590/in/album-72177720307451632/&quot;&gt;the
      magnificent aqueduct in Segovia, Spain&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nWhile this concludes my
      various sets on buildings of Istanbul/Constantinople as seen on land, I&#039;ll
      later post some additional photos from the transits I made from the Dardanelles
      to the Black Sea, and back again.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      three main, geologically derived exterior building materials are on full display:\n\n-
      The random-coursed, rock-faced, and variably toned Fond du Lac Dolostone, a
      relatively rare but fine member of the Regional Silurian Dolostone family.\n\n-
      The Mississippian-subperiod (Lower Carboniferous) Salem Limestone of the columns,
      arches and trim. Architects invariably call this minutely fossiliferous calcarenite
      &amp;quot;Bedford Stone&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Indiana Limestone&amp;quot; instead.\n\n-
      The nicely patined copper of the dome roofs. \n\nWhat a classy combination.\n\nAll
      the fancy sculptural detail and inscription work has been done in the Salem\u2014one
      of this planet&#039;s most carvable rock types. But it is the Fond du Lac, quarried
      near the eponymous Wisconsin city, that gives this Byzantine Revival house of
      worship its striking texture and visual interest.\n\n&lt;b&gt;This site, and
      many others in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming

      this, our final view from the Mycenaean citadel, most of the green and fertile
      floor of the Argos Graben is obscured in a rain haze made opalescent by the
      returning sunshine.  \n\nStill, there&#039;s plenty to look at. Besides the
      foreground rocks of the battlement wall (Pliocene-to-Pleistocene Mycenae Conglomerate,
      Triassic-to-Jurassic Mycenae Limestone, or both), there&#039;s the exposed and
      very stony brown soil of the slope below and the wet and highly reflective surface
      of the archaeological site&#039;s access road. \n\nAnd just beyond the road,
      where there&#039;s that little curving hook of a driveway, is our final stop
      in this series. It&#039;s the so-called Treasury of Atreus, or the Tomb of Agamemnon,
      if you prefer to engage in some Schliemannesque romanticism (though that version
      of the name is not really credited to old Heinrich).\n\nIn fact, it&#039;s a
      magnificent, rock-ribbed tholos tomb of an unknown person or persons. If you
      look closely, you can see the top of its long, narrow entrance marching most
      of the way up its small ridge. \n\nMore on its splendid masonry in the concluding
      two photos in this set!\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      the western elevation is to the left; the southern elevation to the right.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhat
      is all too corporeal in this frame is the flagrant soft-drink billboard, now
      blissfully absent. One can only wonder what the eleventh-century mind (or palate)
      would have made of that splendid product. But I&#039;ll refrain from any reveries
      on the jarring juxtaposition here of medieval and modern, the sacred and the
      profane, and so on.\n\nWhile it may lack some of the architectural fine points
      of its near-contemporaries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53168957021/in/album-72177720303792872/&quot;&gt;the

      Daphni Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, Incorporeal Angels is an absolute sweet pea illustrating
      with admirable simplicity Middle Byzantine masonry techniques and materials
      at least as well as any other site in Attica.\n\nOnce again, the ashlar appears
      to be the soft, pitted, fossiliferous &lt;i&gt;poros&lt;/i&gt; of Pliocene age.
      It&#039;s a marly limestone  quarried in such locales as Megara and Piraeus.\n\nAnd
      then again there&#039;s the cloisonn\xE9 technique of placing very thin bricks
      as spacers between the stone blocks. And the typical brick arches, and the terra-cotta
      roofing tiles, with the arched &lt;i&gt;kalupter&lt;/i&gt; sections alternating
      with the flat &lt;i&gt;solenes&lt;/i&gt; pieces. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other

      height_l=\"1024\" width_l=\"688\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Facing westward.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAllegorical
      female figures were a standard trope of the Victorian-era monumental trade,
      and practically every American cemetery of a certain size and age has its share
      of these classically garbed ladies grieving, symbolizing birth and motherhood,
      representing one profession or another, pointing heavenward, or pensively pondering
      eternity, \n\nThe Hoyt Monument is notable because it sports a whole trio of
      such figures, nicely framed at this time of year by the spreading crown of a
      native Red Oak (&lt;i&gt;Quercus rubra&lt;/i&gt;). \n\nAs succeeding close-ups
      will demonstrate, all of these sculptures and their accompanying ornamerntation
      look as clean-edged and unweathered as they day they were carved 140 years ago.
      Why? Well, for one thing, they&#039;re made of one of the greatest and most
      enduring of American monumental stones, the Narragansett Pier Granite.\n\nQuarried
      in the lovely Rhode Island town of Westerly, which I featured for botanical
      reasons in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52290633179/in/album-72177720301296710/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plant
      Explorer&#039;s Guide to New England&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Narragansett Pier
      is a fine- and tight-grained intrusive igneous rock marketed unsurprisingly
      as &amp;quot;Westerly Granite.&amp;quot; The specific variety used here was
      &amp;quot;Blue Westerly.&amp;quot; (Stone-trade people are forever hyping pale-gray
      rock types as being blue, especially those that are not warm-toned enough to
      be buff or slightly pink.)\n\nPermian in age, the Narragansett Pier formed in
      masses of magma injected into the upper crust during the latter part of Alleghenian
      Orogeny and the assembly of the Pangaean supercontinent, when crustal compression
      was replaced by shearing due to the counterclockwise rotation of southeastern
      New England. It is widely represented in Graceland, Rosehill, Forest Home, and
      other Chicago and Milwaukee cemeteries. During the heyday of its production
      (now sadly ceased), this tough and reliasble stone was a major competitor of
      Vermont&#039;s Barre Granodiorite.\n\nUnfortunately, the very qualities that
      make the Narragansett Pier such a durable selection also make it a trifle boring.
      It lacks the more striking textures and ruddy tones of Wisconsin&#039;s Waupaca,
      Wausau, and Montello alkali-feldspar granites. Or, for that matter, the pleasing
      salt-and-pepper aspect of the Barre. Still, it has been a remarkable performer
      in a brutal continental climate that ofttimes plays havoc with such weak-sister
      varieties as the Shelburne and Carrara Marbles, and the Salem Limestone.   \n\n&lt;b&gt;To
      learn much more about this site and 200 others in the Windy City, make it your
      top personal priority to get a copy of my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago in Stone and

      height_l=\"1024\" width_l=\"678\">\n\t\t<description>This photo is a sort of
      supplement to this set&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52481615607/in/album-72177720302395234/&quot;&gt;Part
      3&lt;/a&gt;, which shows large chunks of basalt that went flying through the
      air back in the Oligocene epoch. That was during one of many volcanic eruptions
      that occurred in Trans-Pecos Texas and adjoining Mexico and New Mexico in that
      infernal episode of prehistory.\n\nSuch big rocks, now embedded in the pyroclastic
      deposits exposed on Tuff Canyon&#039;s walls, are called &lt;i&gt;ballistic
      blocks&lt;/i&gt;, no doubt because of the trajectories they described during
      their brief airborne phase. \n\nBallistic blocks can be distinguished from other
      big stone fragments carried directly along within pyroclastic flows by the &lt;i&gt;impact
      sag&lt;/i&gt; zones located under them. I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; I&#039;m
      seeing one of those depressions under the bigger black boulder in this image,
      but it may be wishful thinking. \n\nAt any rate, this big chunk of Bee Mountain
      Basalt seems to be sitting in a coarse-textured bed more characteristic of a
      &lt;i&gt;lahar&lt;/i&gt; (water-lubricated debris flow) than of a pyroclastic
      surge or flow. Lahar deposits definitely exist at this site, and I&#039;ll show
      another example of one in a photo to follow. \n\nRegardless of whether this
      shot shows true ballistic blocks or not, the fact remains that there are quite
      a few others nearby that unequivocaly are. As I walked about during my visit
      here and saw how many of these lithic projectiles are visible in this relatively
      small cross-section of the volcanic material that blankets this locale, I became
      morbidly fascinated with what it must have been like to actually be on the receiving
      end of this hailstorm from hell. \n\nYears before, I&#039;d been on one active
      volcano (Stromboli) where globs of lava and hot rock were falling nearby, and
      on one other (Etna) where the same had happened a day or two before I got there,
      and there were freshly minted volcanic bombs lying around everywhere. But the
      eruption that hefted Tuff Canyon&#039;s arsenal of mafic missiles would have
      been orders of magnitude more powerful.  \n\nAfter poring over this photo for
      quite a while, I&#039;d like to think that its two boulders are indeed ballistic
      blocks that landed ker-splat into a still-viscous lahar. Either that, or they
      landed first and were then glommed over and buried by that rocky glop.    \n\n&lt;b&gt;My

      height_l=\"683\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt; Looking at a
      portion of the southern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nHere the basic building blocks
      that Frank Lloyd Wright used to create the Robie&#039;s powerful sense of horizontality
      are on full view. To get a better sense of their overall impact, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53189462917/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      9 of this set&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nIn this shot, however, we can best comprehend the
      stratigraphic sandwich that the house really is. Those deep-set square windows
      notwithstanding, the components of primary interest are the red, iron-flecked
      Roman Brick manufactured in St. Louis, Missouri, and the paler and more pedestrian
      Salem Limestone that flanks it. \n\nThe Salem, which just happens to be the
      most commonly encountered architectural rock type in the US, is much better
      known in the quarrying and building trades as Bedford Stone or Indiana Limestone.
      As I say in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52286670650/in/album-72177720301296710/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chicago
      in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:\n\n&lt;i&gt;Once the urban explorer learns
      to recognize the Salem, it\u2019s a constant companion through life, at least
      if one stays in America. In the heart of every city, in each of its suburbs,
      in one-stop-sign towns halfway to Santa Fe, there is always some of this utterly
      unassuming stone lurking. It\u2019s in the official face of the shoebox post
      office, on the Gothic ramparts of the local high school, in the lintels and
      window trim of the side-street Methodist church.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAnd it&#039;s
      on some of the most architecturally distinguished buildings, too. Dating to
      the Mississippian subperiod (Lower Carboniferous), the Salem may seem unremittingly
      bland at a distance, but closer up it often reveals fascinating details. I&#039;ll
      address these in another close-up to follow.\n\nAt this range, what I noted
      in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52353519986/in/album-72177720302658037/&quot;&gt;Part
      10&lt;/a&gt; about Wright&#039;s clever manipulation of mortar\u2014white in
      the horizontal joints and red in the vertical, to accentuate the sense of unbroken
      strata\u2014is more apparent. \n\nThe one beef I have with Wright&#039;s Robie&#039;s
      design is that he, like many a heedless architect before and after him, allowed
      the Salem to extend down to grade. Often, when it comes into contact with the
      ground, and especially sidewalks, this porous rock will absorb meltwater and
      its dissolved deicer salts. The latter can wreak havock later on, in the form
      of efflorescence crusts and the case-hardening and breakdown of the rock itself.
      \n\nBut in this spot at least FLW&#039;s luck seems to have held. The only noticeable
      change to the stone&#039;s surface, besides a few scuffs, is the growth of some
      calciphilic algae.  \n\n&lt;b&gt;For much more on this site and 200 others in
      the Windy City, see my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;, described

      eastward, at this former church&#039;s southern elevation and bell tower.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhat
      I take to be this building&#039;s main exterior material, the Late Cretaceous
      Segovia Sandstone, is complemented in the upper tier of tower windows with red
      brick of unknown date. In those  rather non-Romanesque ogee arches that brick
      seems to be present in quite a range of sizes, and is quite reminiscent of ancient
      Roman brickwork used in the same capacity.\n\nOne aspect of this photo that
      puzzles me a bit is the quite uniform white band atop the blue portion of the
      sky. It may be the straightest-edged bottom of a cloud I&#039;ve ever seen.
      Or perhaps it&#039;s just a zone of the original slide that faded with remarkable
      uniformity. But if so, why was the tower&#039;s weathervane protruding into
      the white layer unaffected? \n\nIn my final shot of San Juan, which will follow,
      I&#039;ll focus on the larger significance of the time in which the Segovia
      Sandstone was deposited. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      southern side of the southwestern corner. For a good overall view of this elevation,

      13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIt&#039;s obvious that Elizabeth and Edward Dodge
      were both artful and geologically astute when they arranged these Lake Michigan
      cobbles in their fancily ridged lime mortar.\n\nBut first, the quoin ashlar.
      It&#039;s highly fosssiliferous and reefal Regional Silurian Dolostone, most
      likely from a quarry a few miles away in Knellsville, Grafton, or Cedarburg.
      Visible here are shell molds and casts of brachiopods, bivalves, or both, and
      probably other invertebrate marine critters are represented as well. \n\nThis
      rock type formed on the edge of the developing crustal downwarp known as the
      Michigan Basin, in shallow, subtropical saltwater. This was at a time when this
      part of Laurentia, North America&#039;s Proterozoic-to-Early-Paleozoic predecessor,
      \ was situated about 30 degrees south of the equator (in contrast to its current
      position, 43 degrees North).  \n\nAs far as the cobbles go, the Dodges lined
      them up, in what appears at this scale to be an attractive but noncyclical way,
      as follows:\n\n- BLACK: mostly Late Mesoproterozoic basalts erupted during the
      Midcontinent Rift event about 1.1 Ga ago; probably from Upper Michigan&#039;s
      Keweenaw Peninsula. Also some gabbro from the same time and area, or a very
      dark-gray granitoid from the Canadian Shield.\n\n- GRAY OR PINK, AND SPECKLED:
      Paleoproterozoic to Archean granitoids from the Canadian Shield. Northern Wisconsin,
      Upper Michigan, or Ontario.\n\n- BONE-WHITE TO BUFF: More Regional Silurian
      Dolostone, from a  more northern locale in eastern Wisconsin or Upper Michigan.
      Some of it seems reefal; some, interreefal and devoid of fossils. (On second
      glance, I do also see a mold of a narrow-conic snail shell. I&#039;ll have to
      look up its genus.)\n\nAll of these rocks were first transported south from
      their outcrop locations by a Wisconsin-stage ice sheet late in the Pleistocene
      ice age. Then they were jostled, caressed, and tumbled into more ovoid or spheroidal
      forms by the lake surf.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      fool reason, in the middle of Clark Street. This is one of the North Side&#039;s
      busiest thoroughfares, and I&#039;m probably lucky I wasn&#039;t run over, or
      at least the subject of some furious ankhing&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nAt this range some
      of the details of the lower facade&#039;s Egyptianate motifs are more apparent.
      Up above the stout columns are scarab medallions and powder-blue and brick-red
      winged emblems of Amon Ra, god of the noonday sun. \n\nAll this and the white,
      coursed cladding were produced by the artisans of the Northwestern Terra Cotta
      Company. That famous firm was situated about twenty blocks west of here, on
      the near bank of the Chicago River&#039;s North Branch. \n\nWhile the manufacturers
      of the city&#039;s Chicago Common Brick usually relied on the clays of local
      glacial-till deposits, Northwestern needed higher-grade base material free of
      pebbles and other impurities. Consequently, it depended on large quantities
      of Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) underclays and marine shales shipped
      in by rail from Illinois Basin coal mines.\n\nTo the miners themselves, the
      underclays were just a waste product; to the Northwestern crew, the stuff of
      high art. But to geologists and paleontologists, they&#039;re something else
      again\u2014the &lt;i&gt;paleosols&lt;/i&gt; or ancient soils in which the giant
      free-sporing scale trees of Pangaean swamp forests had grown some 300 Ma ago.

      sunlit, early-April day, when the leaf buds were just beginning to break.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe
      last I checked, there were two ways to get onto the top of the Natural Bridge:
      \n\n-the direct method involving a set of ancient-looking and in some cases
      disconcertingly loosely anchored metal ladder rungs on the vertical face of
      the Pounds Sandstone; and\n\n- a much more circuitous route via a footpath that
      mounts the bluff more gradually some distance away.\n\nWhen I&#039;ve led tour
      groups here, the latter approach has really been the only option, given that
      some participants are hardly orangutans in the brachiation department. And the
      longer, more leisurely stroll also gives everyone a chance to see the canyon&#039;s
      various botanical wonders. \n\nOne of these wonders is the &amp;quot;lichen
      gardens&amp;quot; (&lt;i&gt;Cladonia&lt;/i&gt; spp. primarily), that have established
      themselves all over the place in the thin, sandy, clifftop substrate. Some of
      these mini-ecosystems can be spotted in the background, as the very-light-green
      patches under the trees on the far side of the stone ramp. Note that even the
      ramp itself hosts quite a selection of lichen, moss, and algal communities.
      \ \n\nAnd looking down at the visible portion of the Bridge&#039;s vertical
      face, it&#039;s possible to see some thin crossbeds exposed in this Lower Pennsylvanian
      (Upper Carboniferous), fluvially deposited sandstone. For a better look at this
      characteristic sedimentary feature in the Pounds, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53181572895/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      3 of this set&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nWhile we&#039;re at it, we might as well be a trifle
      dendrological, as well. The large tree with the exfoliating bark to the left
      is an American Sycamore (&lt;i&gt;Platanus occidentalis&lt;/i&gt;). This, our
      native plane species, can grow to beastly sizes in the Land of Lincoln\u2014especially
      in bottomlands along the Illinois and Wabash Rivers. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on
      this beautiful and geologically fascinating locale, get a copy of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52288266656/in/album-72177720301296710/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Geology

      that extend over long distances make Chinle formation one of the most interesting
      in the Grand Staircase.\n\nChinle mudstone is often very friable and crumbly.
      If you step on it, it leaves a deep boot print. Avoid walking on it, therefore,
      and just photograph it from solid ground.</description>\n\t</photo>\n\t<photo

      facing eastward, but this time we&#039;re looking at closer range, at the lower
      portion of the western elevation.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nOf the exterior building materials
      on view here, two are fully documented. And the third, the  pale-buff, rock-faced
      ashlar, can be identified in a general sort of way with a high degree of confidence.
      It&#039;s almost certainly Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) from the eastern
      side of Wisconsin. \n\nMy guess is that it is specifically the RSD variety I
      call the Wauwatosa Dolostone, quarried in the Menomonee River Valley just west
      of Milwaukee. I know it was definitely used for one of the campus halls of Beloit
      College, not that far from here. However, rock virtually indistinguishable from
      this was also produced in other communities in the greater Cream City area.\n\nIn
      any event, this close carbonate cousin of true limestone was deposited some
      425 Ma ago in shallow, reef-studded waters on the western fringe of the great
      crustal downwarp known as the Michigan Basin.\n\nOn this exterior, the Wauwatosa
      (or whatever) provides a dramatic contrast to the ruddier tones of the Maiden
      Rock Brick and the Paleoproterozoic-era Montello Granite of the pillar shafts.

      feature at Cape Perpetua on the Oregon coast.  The well is the result of the
      collapse of the roof of a sea cave.  It is approximately 18 feet wide and 20
      feet deep.  The dog accompanying the man taking shots of the well has had enough!
      \ I didn&#039;t go down to the edge as I am clumsy enough on flat ground, much
      less on uneven, slippery basalt with waves surging around. Plus, the spray is
      intense.  I value my life and my cameras more than the excitement of getting

      and even postapocalyptic as this photo seems, it shows more detail of the building&#039;s
      once-beautiful masonry. Obviously there have been modifications and patching
      with newer ashlar blocks over the centuries, but at the very least the older
      stuff is the Miocene-epoch Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone. And some of the original
      red-brick belt coursing is still there, too.  \n\nI&#039;d love to find out
      if the surviving timber beam remnants so prominently visible here were original
      as well. And what tree species were they cut from? I could speculate that they
      were some sort of native oak, but idle speculation is often worse than worthless.
      I&#039;ll continue to investigate.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      height_l=\"768\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Facing northeastward
      at the building&#039;s facade (southern elevation) as well as its western side.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAn
      arresting m\xE9lange of three not always reconcilable architectural styles\u2014Richardsonian
      Romanesque, Second Empire, and Renaissance Revival\u2014Old City Hall as restored
      is quite the colorful Yooper showboat. (And in case you don&#039;t already know,
      Yooper = a resident of the UP = the Upper Peninsula.) \n\nGiven its maroons
      and reds and pinks, it should by rights be the City Hall of Helium, Mars, and
      one could easily imagine Dejah Thoris and John Carter striking a pose in front
      of its main entrance. But then the redness fits here, too, because Marquette
      was one of North America&#039;s great brownstone production centers when this
      edifice was erected.\n\nIt always warms the cockles of my heart when I learn
      that a community&#039;s elders or its &lt;i&gt;vox populi&lt;/i&gt; insisted
      on their new municipal building being made of local materials. And such was
      the case here. While I don&#039;t know the story behind the roofing tiles, I&#039;ve
      discovered that the ashlar, the Jacobsville Sandstone variety of Lake Superior
      Brownstone, was extracted just south of town, in what seems to have been Marquette&#039;s
      main quarrying district.\n\nThe other main building material, which I henceforth
      christen Marquette Brick, was also manufactured nearby. I need to find out what
      its source material was\u2014glacial till? some hematite-rich shale deposited
      along with the Jacobsville atop the lava flows of the Midcontinent Rift?  So
      far this is my one documented use of this brick type, though I&#039;m sure there
      are various others.\n\nThe Marquette brand of the Jacobsville, on the other
      hand, was definitely exported far and wide, and in this photo set I&#039;ve
      described and will continue to describe its uses in other cities. For example,
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52713964938/in/album-72177720306314298/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      end of our track, along the Boquillas Canyon Trail. We are on high ground, not
      far from the trailhead parking lot, and we&#039;re looking south-southwestward.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nBefore
      entering the vertiginous, awe-inspiring landscape of Boquillas Canyon proper,
      it&#039;s only fitting that we take a look at the twists and turns of the Rio
      Grande a bit upstream, in less dramatic terrain. Besides the point bars and
      the floodplain plant communities there are the low erosional landforms on the
      far, Mexican side of the river. \n\nJust to the left of this frame rises the
      massive, fault-scarped rampart of the Sierra del Carmen, famed for its sunset
      colors, and the great notch of the canyon&#039;s mouth. Before venturing in
      among the cliffs and hoodoos of Lower Cretaceous limestone, we&#039;ll take
      a look at one of this national park&#039;s weirdest and most striking plants,
      a member of a family usually found in wetter, tropical climes. That&#039;s next.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      height_l=\"683\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Taken from a spot
      between Grave Circle A and the lip of the great wall of Mycenae&#039;s citadel
      (acropolis). Looking southwestward at outer excavations, the site access road,
      and the parking lot. Beyond lies the valley of the Argos Graben, wrapped in
      haze&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nThe rectangular-chambered ruin complex in the middle ground
      is the so-called Oil-Merchant&#039;s House Group, sometimes rendered as the
      Oil-Trader&#039;s House instead. It reportedly dates to the 13th century BC,
      as does much of the works above it.\n\nAt this range it&#039;s difficult to
      tell if the surviving wall segments were constructed of Mycenae Limestone (Upper
      Triassic to  Middle Jurassic, quarried on surrounding hills) or the Pliocene-to-Pleistocene
      Mycenae Conglomerate obtained on the floor of the graben below. Probably there&#039;s
      some of both, as is often the case here.\n\nThere&#039;s also a nice cut of
      limestone-derived&lt;i&gt;terra rossa&lt;/i&gt; soil horizon on the far side
      of the roadway. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this

      through a narrow cataract that drops 61 m (200 ft) into a bowl formed in the
      canyon which is 115 m (377 ft) deep. Exposing a large cross-section of the Columbia
      River Basalt Group, the current moves swiftly through a winding gorge of columnar
      basalt, to its southern end at the mighty Snake River.\nCarved more than 13,000
      years ago, Palouse Falls is among the last active waterfalls on the Ice Age
      floods path. At the end of the last ice age, repeated glacial floods known as
      the Missoula Floods, swept across eastern Washington carving out the unique
      scablands landscape we see today. \nThis natural wonder was named Washington\u2019s
      state waterfall in 2014, when the state legislature passed a bill written by
      elementary school students in the nearby town of Washtucna, who had advocated
      for the designation. It had been dedicated as Palouse Falls State Park on June
      3, 1951.</description>\n\t</photo>\n\t<photo id=\"53195466740\" owner=\"29409244@N03\"

      height_l=\"675\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Looking northwestward.
      This is the church&#039;s southern (actually southwestern) elevation, which
      reportedly retains much of the original building&#039;s design and materials.&lt;/i&gt;
      \n\nHoly Trinity, the largest of Athenian Byzantine-era churches, has served
      the city&#039;s Russian Orthodox community since its nineteenth-century rehabilitation
      from its previous ruinous state.\n\nAs much as I love Date Palms (&lt;i&gt;Phoenix
      dactylifera&lt;/i&gt;) and have extolled their use as street trees on my own
      native continent\u2014for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52513127510/in/album-72177720302478879/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
      and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52519784414/in/album-72177720302478879/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;\u2014I
      dearly wish the tree in the middle of this frame had been planted elsewhere.
      \n\nStill, a fair portion of the characteristic Middle-Byzantine cloisonn\xE9
      masonry is visible nonetheless. A quick check on Google Earth confirms that
      all the palms have since been removed, though the garden planting at far left
      has survived.  \n\nInterestingly, Holy Trinity is essentially a three-quarters-size
      replica of the much more famous &lt;i&gt;katholikon&lt;/i&gt; of the Hosios
      Loukas Monastery, built not that long before in the wilds of Boeotia.\n\nRegarding
      this church, I&#039;m forced as usual to speculate about the geologic origins
      of the rough-faced, puckery, and presumably pretty soft ashlar that is set between
      those typically wafer-thin, double-coursed bricks. Sources I&#039;ve consulted
      have much to say about the building&#039;s history, but not about the identity
      of its stone. But the rock does seem to be a dead ringer for &lt;i&gt;poros&lt;/i&gt;\u2014the
      Pliocene-epoch marly and fossiliferous limestone quarried in Megara and Piraeus.\n\nHoly
      Trinity Church is also notable for being dercorated with the kind of pseudo-Kufic
      symbols so strikingly displayed on the contemporary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53128047076/in/album-72177720303792872/&quot;&gt;Holy
      Apostles Church&lt;/a&gt; in the Agora. Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t seem
      to be visible from this image&#039;s vantagepoint. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other

      and looking at the midsection of the Entrance Gate&#039;s eastern side.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAnyone
      familiar with the Windy City&#039;s iconic Water Tower &amp;amp; Pumping Station
      will have no trouble identifying this structure&#039;s architect\u2014William
      C. Boyington. That man certainly had a thing for turrets and castellation. And,
      of course, for Lemont-Joliet Dolostone, the Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD)
      variety so widely used in the city&#039;s formative decades. Here it&#039;s
      present in rock-faced and regular-to-random-coursed form. \n\nWinter is definitely
      the time to see this fine display of carbonate sedimentary rock at its best,
      when it&#039;s not partially obscured with the foliage of vines that have been
      permitted to establish such a substantial toehold here. Note the stone&#039;s
      subtly varying weathering tints that give the Lemont-Joliet and other RSD types
      so much warmth and character. \n\nThe topographic high on which the cemetery
      is located is the Rosehill (or Rose Hill) Spit, an elongated, north-south deposit
      of sand and gravel created by longshore currents approximately 11.5 ka ago,
      during the Calumet highstand of ancestral Lake Chicago.\n\nOriginally this landform
      was dubbed Roe&#039;s Hill, after an early property owner. But in the cemetery&#039;s
      charter papers it was mistakenly listed as the phonetically identical Rose Hill,
      which in latter days has been elided into Rosehill. \n\nThe fact that the plaque
      above Entrance Gate&#039;s archway uses the modern form of the name makes me
      think it is of relatively recent date.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To learn much more about
      this site and 200 others in the Windy City, make it your top personal priority

      through yellow, crimson, and lavender hills, giving you a close view of the
      incredible popcorn-textured claystone that distinguishes the Painted Hills.
      \nThe colors and hills were formed over 35 million years ago by many volcanic
      eruptions and changing climate patterns. Layers of ash and soil mixed with mineral
      and plant matter, coupled with erosion, formed the hills that we see today.</description>\n\t</photo>\n\t<photo

      harmonious blend of brick and stone is one of Frank Lloyd Wright&#039;s more
      famous Prairie Style designs, and it&#039;s also one of his most geologically
      savvy and significant. It demonstrates the imprint of Midwestern stratigraphy
      on the architect&#039;s mind. \n\nThe flat-lying sedimentary strata of Wright&#039;s
      early stomping grounds, southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois, are elegantly
      restated here in alternating elements of red St. Louis Brick and buff Salem
      Limestone. As succeeding photos will show, Wright and his brickmasons took special
      pains to emphasize the sense of horizontality he&#039;d already seen expressed
      in the regional outcrops.\n\nThe St. Louis Brick, iron-flecked and shaped in
      long, shallow Roman form, was manufactured from the Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous)
      Cheltenham Clay, an ancient soil horizon in which giant coal-swamp trees once
      grew. It was mined directly under that great city on the Mississippi.\n\nThe
      Salem Limestone, better known to architects as &amp;quot;Bedford Stone&amp;quot;
      or &amp;quot;Indiana Limestone,&amp;quot; is the one most prevalent architectural
      rock type in the US. Composed of marine-animal fossil fragments naturally cemented
      together with calcite, it&#039;s Mississippian (Lower Carboniferous) in age.

      at the facade (western elevation) and a portion of the southern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nEven
      when I visited it in 1978, this former house of worship had been a private residence
      for almost three-quarters of a century. Nowadays it serves as the Museo Zuloaga.\n\nSan
      Juan de los Caballeros was the oldest Romanesque structure I saw when I was
      in Segovia. However, those conversant with this architectural style will immediately
      spot one unusual feature here: the great Gothic arch of the entryway. \n\nI
      assume this impressive portal was added at some point after the initial construction;
      the Gothic mode is usually thought to have originated more than a hundred years
      after San Juan was raised. But the descriptions of this specific site I&#039;ve
      found so far do not address this issue\u2014other to note that that section
      of the facade also incorporates remains of an earlier Visigothic (6th century)
      church.\n\nIn any case, it&#039;s evident after checking Google Earth Street
      View that the building has been at least partially renovated since I photographed
      it. For one thing, the badly deteriorated ashlar under the blind arches has,
      I gather, been replaced or reconstituted. My suposition is that it is (or at
      least was) one of the town&#039;s two standard architectural-rock types, the
      Upper Cretaceous Segovia Sandstone. \n\nLooking at the crumbling stonework,
      it reminds me a lot of other case-hardened sandstone I&#039;ve seen elsewhere.
      But, as I keep having to say, provenance is lacking.\n\nAnother change for the
      better one can see today is that the wonderful arched porch colonnades that
      were so indecorously walled up in this image are open again, though the ones
      in front are now backed by decidedly non-Romanesque glass windows.  \n\nI wonder
      if the higher degree of destructive stone weathering I saw at this location
      was at all linked to San Juan&#039;s location, overlooking the north-facing
      cliff of the city&#039;s rocky heights. Or were the masons of the late 11th
      century just less selective in choosing good-quality sandstone than their 12th-
      and 13th-century successors?\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      The porch and main entrance are on the building&#039;s western side; also visible
      is the considerably less altered northern elevation. &lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis vantagepoint
      may not reveal the full impact of the original cobblestone exterior or the complementing
      Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) quoins the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53162290218/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      Part 13 photo&lt;/a&gt; does. But at least it shows the Lannon Dolostone pillars
      and bay-window base of the 1930s addition to good effect. \n\nThe Lannon, a
      RSD variety quarried to this day about 20 mi (32 km) to the southwest of Port
      Washington, is often extracted in thin-bedded, flaggy sections more suitable
      for veneer than real ashlar blocks. Most often it is face-mounted in pieces
      of varying size and shape, in random-course fashion. And so it is here.\n\nOne
      of the most attractive aspects of the Lannon\u2014besides its smaller amount
      of spalling and exfoliation compared to northeastern Illinois&#039; Lemont-Joliet
      variety\u2014is its polychromatic weathering profile. Some sections retain their
      original pale-gray color for decades, whereas others turn warmer tones of buff,
      gold, and even ocher.\n\nIn the shots that follow we&#039;ll focus more fully
      on the Dodge House&#039;s original building materials. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the

      at the warehouse&#039;s southwestern and southeastern elevations.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhat
      at first glance may seem an uninteresting, utilitarian structure is in fact
      one of the Windy City&#039;s most delightful expressions of architectural noncontextuality\u2014a
      concept I&#039;m always willing to admire, praise, and promote. As will become
      apparent in the photos that follow, the Reebie Warehouse boldly dares to relate
      to nothing whatsoever around it, and not even to itself.\n\nTo really appreciate
      the salutary incongruity present here, you need to lower your gaze to the first
      story of the building&#039;s Clark Street facade. It was there that, at the
      request of the original owners, designer George S. Kingsley provided something
      rarely seen in storage warehouses, at least since the Ptolemaic Dynasty: a whopping
      dose of Ancient Egyptian design motifs. \n\nThis remarkable Roaring-Twenties
      riff on pharaonic magnificence, breathtaking in its cognitive dissonance, was
      executed in polychrome terra-cotta crafted twenty blocks to the west, in Chicago&#039;s
      Northwestern works. \n\nNorthwestern&#039;s base material was derived from Pennsylvanian-subperiod
      (Upper Carboniferous) underclays and marine shales unearthed in the bituminous-coal
      mines of the Illinois Basin, and then shipped up to the big city by rail. \n\nThe
      pictures that follow will concentrate, at considerably closer range, on the
      wonderful terra-cotta cladding that was produced from this 300-Ma-old material.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For

      at the spring freshet, shows at closer range the same section of the rear wall
      seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53159635961/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      Part 2 photo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis is quite a complicated patchwork of
      shade and sunlight and contrasting colors, all seen through a curtain of water
      droplets falling from the cliff edge above. Still, the strata of the thin-bedded
      Pounds Sandstone are perfectly visible with their well-preserved &lt;i&gt;crossbedding&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nThe
      Pounds, a member of the Lower Pennsylvanian (early Upper Carboniferous) Caseyville
      Formation, was deposited by streams like the  Bell Smith Springs canyon&#039;s
      own modern-day Bay Creek. In other words, they too were incised into older bedrock.
      And the left-to-right direction of their flow is indicated by the slanting crossbeds.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For

      interior focuses on both the Ancient Roman Brick facing and the Ancient Roman
      Concrete exposed above and below it. \n\nThe latter building material is so
      alien to our modern conception of concrete\u2014the smooth-textured Ready Mix
      stuff that&#039;s poured out of a truck and forms something pretty reminiscent
      of compact, slightly sandy limestone\u2014that we think of it as stonemasonry
      instead. And here it does appear to be about 1 part lime-pozzolana mortar to
      9 parts cobbles (or brick fragments or broken tiles, or whatever the exact roster
      of aggregrate ingedients is in this case).\n\nBut how well it worked. When I
      think of all the less-than-a-century-old concrete structures in my own country
      that are in bad need of repair, I have all the more respect for Imperial builders
      and architects who accomplished so much with such rudimentary technology, and
      with so little formal understanding of chemistry and materials science. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For

      My razor-sharp directional sense thereby deduces that we&#039;re looking at
      the building&#039;s western elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIn my humble opinion, one
      of the greatest glories of American architecture is found far from its biggest
      cities, in its nineteenth-century rural county courthouses. And if they happen
      to be constructed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, as here, so much the
      better. \n\nThese distinctive structures are the incarnation of local civic
      pride in the last places in this country where democracy still works. Everything
      about them hearkens back to a very different world. In fact, they&#039;re miniature
      worlds in themselves. Their ceiling-fanned, oak-paneled hallways and clerks&#039;
      offices are populated with warmhearted people named Vern and Darlene, and tend
      to give off a composite scent of Lysol, prairie soil, floor wax, and legal documents
      aged like fine wine in century-old filing cabinets.\n\nThere&#039;s so much
      to explore, inside and out. What&#039;s visible here is an especially impressive
      array of building materials, all obtained, in an admirable display of Badger
      State solidarity, from Wisconsin sources. The Green County Courthouse and adjoining
      Civil War Monument\u2014there always has to be an adjoining Civil War Monument\u2014are
      so geologically rich that I&#039;m going to devote several posts to them. At
      least several.\n\nThe most striking component of the exterior is that luridly
      lovely red brick. It could easily pass for a premium-grade Philadelphia facing
      variety, but according to local documents it actually hails from the Upper-Mississippi-Valley
      hamlet of Maiden Rock, about 250 road mi (402 km) northwest of Monroe. Whether
      its clay was mined from Quaternary deposits laid down by the Father of the Waters,
      I don&#039;t know. This production locality was not cited in any publications
      on Wisconsin brickmaking I&#039;ve come across so far.   \n\nThe contrasting
      yellowish-buff, rock-faced ashlar is described in my sources simply as &amp;quot;limestone.&amp;quot;
      But it&#039;s actually dolostone. For reasons I&#039;ll discuss in future photo
      descriptions, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the locally quarried Plattevile-Galena
      rock of Ordovician age, but rather reefal Regional Silurian Dolostone from Wauwatosa
      or some other place in the eastern section of the state. \n\nAlso on display,
      if just barely, is the ruddy and almost supernaturally hard Montello Granite
      in the shafts of the porch pillars. It formed as part of magma emplacement connected
      with a megavolcanic eruption event in the Paleoproterozoic. But more on that
      anon.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit

      height_l=\"1024\" width_l=\"707\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Taken in what
      was then the roofless shell of the Palace. I believe we&#039;re facing the junction
      of the western and southern walls, but after all these years I can&#039;t be
      sure.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe heavy growth of moss or some other type of vegetation
      on the vertical surfaces makes the pattern of masonry quite indistinct in places.
      But a little scrutiny reveals that there&#039;s the same alternation of Miocene-epoch
      Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone with horizontal bands of red brick seen in &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53158000485/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      3&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nNone of the free-range fowl who followed me into the ruined
      building are visible in this shot, but they&#039;ll make their appearance in
      a later image. I&#039;d like to think they were inspired by my own geological
      and architectural curiosity. But they, being true to their chicken-brained nature,
      probably just thought I was there to feed them.\n\nSome of the upper window
      arches clearly show the decorative effect of stone alternating with thick-mortared
      bricks. There also seem to be some much more recently added stone or concrete
      blocks farther down. They are of a much more uniform shape than the rest of
      the ashlar. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this series,

      and toward the cathedral&#039;s facade (western elevation) and southern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis
      handsome Neo-Byzantine edifice is one of the most striking and effective twentieth-century
      expressions of Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) I&#039;ve seen. \n\nGeologically
      speaking, St. Sava is particularly distinctive because it&#039;s clad not in
      the usual latter-day RSD selection, Lannon Dolostone, but in very similar rock
      quarried about 40 mi (65 km) farther north, on the southern outskirts of Fond
      du Lac, Wisconsin. \n\nThe Fond du Lac Dolostone on display here is a subtly
      varicolored rock type that, like the Lannon, is shown to its best effect as
      random-coursed, rock-faced cladding. \n\nIn addition, the church exterior features
      portal elements, trim, and window surrounds of light-gray Salem (&amp;quot;Bedford,&amp;quot;
      &amp;quot;Indiana&amp;quot;) Limestone. This Mississippian-subperiod (Lower
      Carboniferous) biocalcarenite is often used as a blander and much more carvable
      complement to RSD varieties. \n\nAlso notice the copper roofs of the domes,
      nave, and transepts. In the course of fifty-five years, they&#039;ve reach their
      metal&#039;s end-state of weathering\u2014the bluish-green patina characteristic
      of copper sulfate and copper carbonate compounds.\n\n&lt;b&gt;This site, and
      many others in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming
      book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53241541841/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;

      western side of Rio Grande Village Road, about 0.2 road mi (0.4 km) northeast
      of the big Tornillo Creek Bridge. This vantagepoint is a few tens of meters/yards
      northeast of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53152838457/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      Part 6 photo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nI arrived at this site none too soon.
      A few minutes later the shadow evident at bottom had obscured even the crest
      of this rise. As it was, though, the low-angle light of late afternoon beautifully
      highlighted the dike of igneous rock cutting through Upper Cretaceous Pen Formation
      shale and claystone. The Pen beds closest to the dike were cooked into somewhat
      harder form when the magma forced its way into them. This is a very localized
      version of what geologists call &lt;i&gt;contact metamorphism&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nAlso
      getting its last dose of direct sun is a scraggily cluster of what I suppose
      is Faxon Yucca (&lt;i&gt;Yucca faxoniana&lt;/i&gt;). This species is better
      known in Trans-Pecos Texas as Dagger\u2014a fitting tribute to its lethally
      pointed, rigid, and sword-shaped leaves.  \n\nAs you can see for yourself on
      Google Earth, in both aerial and street views, the dike actually runs straight
      as an arrow on both sides of the road. But, as noted in the previous description,
      I can find no source that identifies its exact petrologic composition. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      the shaft-grave walls in this famous burial complex.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nWhile the
      unmortared rubble blocks on view in this shot are probably too small to be considered
      &lt;i&gt;cyclopean&lt;/i&gt;\u2014the help of a mythical one-eyed giant wouldn&#039;t
      have been required to heft them\u2014they are just about as diverse in shape
      as they are monolithic in the type of stone they represent. \n\nThe fact that
      the larger chunks of rock are being held in place by so many wedgelike smaller
      ones makes me wonder whether this wall was largely rebuilt in the nineteenth
      century AD or later by archaeological excavators. I have trouble imagining all
      those tidy little bits surviving in their appointed nooks since the Late Bronze
      Age.\n\nHowever recent or ancient this particular masonry is, the material it&#039;s
      made of, the locally quarried Mycenae Limestone, has a history that stretches
      back more than 200 Ma. It was in the span from the Upper Triassic to the Middle
      Jurassic periods of the Mesozoic era that this sedimentary rock began as limey
      mud deposited on a carbonate platform in the Tethys Ocean. At that time, that
      great saltwater seaway stretched all the way from Spain to what is now Southeast
      Asia. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this series,

      at the church&#039;s eastern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nI&#039;m not sure what
      sort of repair or restoration work was underway during my visit, but I am sure
      that nothing would have tempted me to walk up that ramshackle timber ramp.  \n\nOne
      of the distinctive design features of Sts. Theodores is that has three triple-sided
      apses. I would love to think there was some doubling down on Trinitarian symbolism
      going on here, but I may just be playing too much into it.\n\nIn any event,
      this vantagepoint offers a great view both of the pitted &amp;quot;poros&amp;quot;
      ashlar\u2014probably either Piraeus Limestone or Megara Limestone, both of which
      are marly, highly fossiliferous, and Pliocene\u2014and the brick-and-stone cloisonn\xE9
      masonry so typical of Athenian Middle Byzantine style.\n\nIn this shot, the
      terra-cotta &lt;i&gt;solenes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;kalupter&lt;/i&gt; tiles
      look pretty mossy and patched in places with some whitish material (concrete?).
      Much more modern imagery on Google Earth Street View shows the roof in better
      shape overall. \n\nAlso note the striking brick-and-thick-mortar patterns adorning
      the upper reaches of the arched windows.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos
