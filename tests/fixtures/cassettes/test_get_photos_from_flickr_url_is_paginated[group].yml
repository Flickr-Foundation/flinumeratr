      made it to the relative saftety of the sidewalk. Looking up Clark Street, at
      the building&#039;s northern half.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nFor my current book-writing
      project, &lt;i&gt;Chicago Suburbs in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;, I&#039;ve been
      reviewing for the umpteenth time the surprisingly abundant geologic literature
      on the sand-and-gravel spits that now form low ridges in the city, the North
      Shore, and Oak Park and Forest Park areas. \n\nThis foray into spitology reminded
      me that North Clark and its unusual northwest-southeast trend is the result
      of its being the crest of the Graceland Spit. This landform, named for the graveyard
      I feature prominently in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670513&quot;&gt;my
      &lt;i&gt;Cemetery Science&lt;/i&gt; album&lt;/a&gt;, was built in the nearshore
      waters of Lake Chicago about 5.5 ka ago. \n\nIn previous shots of this series,
      I&#039;ve described the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company cladding, formed from
      Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) clays mined in the Illinois Basin, that
      adorns the lower portion of this storage warehouse. Here it is at much closer
      range.\n\nOf course the most eye-catching item is the olive-skinned representation
      of one of the original Reebie Brothers decked out as Ramses II. His sibling
      is an identical Ramses II, out of sight on the other side of the entrance. \n\nBut
      the rest of the building&#039;s face is a nice assortment of botanical references,
      especially to &lt;i&gt;Nymphaea lotus&lt;/i&gt;, the Egyptian Lotus. This aquatic
      plant was to the ancients a potent symbol of death and resurrection. Its flower
      buds emerge and rise above the waters of the Nile and open by day, then close
      and submerge again at night, and reemerge the following day.\n\nThe Egyptian
      Lotus is present here both in closed-bud and opened-flower forms. And there
      are also palm-leaf motifs in the capitals of the squat columns. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For

      roof of the Natural Bridge, a little farther across the span than the &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53271012034/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      5&lt;/a&gt; location.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nHere we&#039;re looking at the gap between
      the Bridge and the bluff. I especially like this shot because it shows a good
      uniformitarian process: water, that great and patient eroder, flows over the
      lip of the cliff. Year after year, decade after decade, century after century,
      little spring-freshet streams like this gradually widen what was once a narrow
      &lt;i&gt;joint&lt;/i&gt;\u2014a fracture in bedrock where no appreciative displacement
      has occurred between the two sides. \n\nAnd in this case, what was once part
      of the cliff eventually became a detached slice of rock, hollowed out below
      when the water hit a shale layer and had to move outward rather than farther
      downward.\n\nThis water and rock are also the basis of all the green communities,
      algal films to tall-growing vascular plants, than live atop and on the sides
      of the exposed Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) Pounds Sandstone. Any geologist
      who is not also enraptured by the biota, and any biologist blind to the geology,
      are missing the essential fusion of things that makes all divisions of scientific
      study artificial constructions. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this beautiful and
      geologically fascinating locale, get a copy of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Geology

      the view is from the porch on the building&#039;s eastern side.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nHere
      there&#039;s plenty of what I take to be Regional Silurian Dolostone from Wauwatosa,
      or some other source near Milwaukee. But in this description I focus instead
      on the stout, polished column shafts.\n\nAs I noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53267563072/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      11&lt;/a&gt;, the shafts were fashioned from blocks of Montello Granite, an
      igneous intrusive rock with a mineralogical composition that is reputedly up
      to 40 percent quartz. This means that the effort it took to cut, shape, and
      polish this stone was much greater than it would have been to process competing
      granite varieties. One example of this: whereas a cutting wire works through
      about 4 ft (1.2 m) of normal granite per hour; the same device only makes it
      through 8 in (0.2 m) of the Montello in the same amount of time. \n\nNaturally,
      this drove up the latter&#039;s price\u2014as did the fact that only about 10
      percent of the rock extracted at the Montello, Wisconsin quarry was deemed suitable
      for architectural or monumental use.\n\nClassed as an alkali-feldspar granite,
      the Montello has been dated to about 1.75 Ga in the Paleoproterozoic era. This
      is interesting, given that that timeframe lies about 100 Ma after the Penokean
      Orogeny and about 50 Ma before the Yavapai Orogeny. Such crust-crunching, mountain-building
      events are thought to be a main source of granite-pluton production. But this
      sort of activity was noticeably absent in Wisconsin at 1.75 Ga. \n\nHowever,
      alkali-feldspar granites are thought to often originate in a different way,
      in extensional environments\u2014where the crust is being pulled, thinned, and
      rifted. So perhaps that was the case when the bodies of magma that formed the
      Montello and associated extrusive rhyolites rose from the lower crust. One mechanism
      that causes such extension is called &lt;i&gt;slab rollback&lt;/i&gt;. It occurs
      when subducting oceanic crust steepens its angle and causes the adjacent continental
      margin to stretch. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of

      from what was then a nice bed of hybrid tea roses toward the temple&#039;s eastern
      and northern elevations.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nPaestum&#039;s three splendid Doric temples
      are largely constructed with a rock type I informally call the Paestum Travertine.
      It should not be confused with the much more famous and much more widely utilized
      Tivoli Travertine quarried far to the north, in the Acque Albule region west
      of Rome (and found in some abundance even on modern buildings in my barbarian
      Trans-Atlantic region). \n\nThe Paestum rock type, like the Tivoli, derives
      from a carbonate deposit formed from calcium-rich water. In this case, the water
      source was the nearby Capodifiume springs, which from the Pleistocene epoch
      to the present have apparently built out this site&#039;s surrounding coastal
      plain quite significantly. \n\nAnother Quaternary-period building material found
      on the First Temple of Hera is a very young clastic rock, taken from  Holocene
      dune ridges, which I identify as the Paestum Sandstone. It was used on the structure&#039;s
      upper portions, particularly the metopes.\n\nBoth of these locally quarried
      selections are probably endemic to this archaeological site. But they certainly
      have withstood the test of time to a remarkable degree.\n\nPhotos and descriptions
      of Hera&#039;s Second Temple, and of Athena&#039;s only one, will follow. \n\n\n

      height_l=\"920\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Looking at the
      central and eastern portions of the building&#039;s facade (southern elevation).
      &lt;/i&gt;\n\nI keep trying to put all of its design elements together in my
      mind as some sort of coherent whole, but can never quite make it. Still, from
      a geological standpoint, Old City Hall is certainly a fascinating farrago of
      different materials one can scrutinize as though they&#039;re their own separate
      entities floating free of one another.\n\nFirst, of course, is all that terrific,
      maroon-and-mottled rock. It&#039;s locally quarried Jacobsville Sandstone, which
      was deposited atop the great mafic lava outpourings of the Midcontinent Rift
      (MCR). The rifting event itself was possibly caused by a rare combination of
      two separate events:\n\n- Crustal thinning and extension caused by the separation
      of Laurentia (ancestral North America) from Amazonia, and\n\n- This part of
      Laurentia passing over a mantle plume.\n\nWhile the eruptive phase of the MCR
      is constrained quite nicely to ca. 1.1 Ga (Upper Mesoproterozoic era), it&#039;s
      not known for sure how long afterward the Jacobsville was deposited. Estimates
      have ranged from &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; late Mesoproterozoic to early Cambrian,
      an uncomfortably long span of about 500 Ma. Unfortunately this rock type lacks
      index fossils and other diagnostic features geochronologists rely on.\n\nThe
      Jacobsville is complemented by a lot of lighter-toned Marquette Brick, another
      buillding material produced in this locale. I&#039;ve discussed it a bit more
      fully in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53205525427/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      21 of this set&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nAnd while I can find no proof of this yet, I&#039;m
      guessing the porch&#039;s column shafts are Montello Granite, the red, quartz-saturated
      igneous rock from the town of that name in Wisconsin. It&#039;s also possible
      that it&#039;s the Peterhead variety of Scotland&#039;s Aberdeenshire Granite.
      But by the 1890s most courthouse and town-hall architects in the Upper Midwest
      were using the domestically produced Montello. \n\nClose-ups of the facade will
      follow. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this series,

      9&lt;/a&gt; locale, along the trail leading to the mouth of Boquillas Canyon.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAt
      this point it&#039;s clear that I suffer from Hechtexiomania, the condition
      of being  too emotionally invested in &lt;i&gt;Hechtia texensis&lt;/i&gt;. This
      member of the Pineapple Family (Bromeliaceae) has adapted itself to Big Bend&#039;s
      parched and infernal Chihuahuan Desert conditions. Wherever I found it in the
      park, I photographed it and marveled at its affinity for living in cracks and
      crevices of Cretaceous-limestone outcrops, as here.\n\nUnlike the plants shown
      in the previous shot, this individual was not in flower. But it does display
      the salient characteristics of its narrow, sharply toothed leaves. Those lower
      in the rosette are flushed deep red; the upper ones show the silvery scales
      that are, I assume, a moisture-retaining adaptation. \n\nWhile as noted in earlier
      descriptions I roundly dislike this species&#039;s common name, False Agave,
      I have to admit that the plant often does have a more regularly radial, agave-ish
      habit. But here the foliage is quite inrolled and contorted, to the point it
      almost seems to belong to a &lt;i&gt;Tillandsia&lt;/i&gt; &amp;quot;air plant&amp;quot;
      instead. But, dagnabbit, &lt;i&gt;H. texensis&lt;/i&gt; this specimen surely
      is.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this set and my

      toward the monumental, slot-in-the-hill entrance to this tholos, which is also
      known as the &amp;quot;Tomb of Agamemnon.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; \n\n&lt;b&gt;Behold
      Bronze Age Building Skills at Their Boldest! \nStonework on Steroids! Colossal
      Chunks of Conglomerate! Amazing Ashlar! Massive Masonry! Lovely Lithic Artistry!
      Petrologic Perfection!&lt;/b&gt;\n\nNow that I&#039;ve gotten that disturbing
      alliterative outburst out of my system, let me identify the stone a little more
      precisely as the coarse-textured clastic sedimentary rock I informally call
      the Mycenae Conglomerate. Pliocene to Pleistocene in age, it was quarried on
      the floor of the Argos Graben nearby. It&#039;s also seen extensively in &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52322614536/in/album-72177720303812060/&quot;&gt;the
      walls of Mycenae&#039;s citadel&lt;/a&gt;, just 0.4 km (0.25 mi) to the northeast.
      \n\nI&#039;ve come across various accounts of fancier stone types that were
      originally used to adorn this beehive tomb. I&#039;ll discuss one or two of
      them in the following photo&#039;s description. \n\nHere, however, it&#039;s
      worth noting that at least one reference mentions that the front exterior was
      clad in some sort of &amp;quot;marble&amp;quot; from the southern part of the
      Peloponnese. Whether this was the striking green Krokees Porphyry (known in
      Italian stonemason lingo as the &amp;quot;Porfido verde antico&amp;quot;), I&#039;m
      not sure. Greece is so rich in nifty rock types that one has only to walk about
      fourteen paces from an outcrop of one variety to find yet another. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      so this is the western elevation. This site is situated in the Plaka, in a narrow
      defile on the northern flank of the Acropolis.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nSources I&#039;ve
      come across describe this church&#039;s subsequent modifications in less than
      admiring terms. And indeed, its facade seems to have been redone by the local
      equivalent of the Impromptu Fixit Company, employing a decidedly sloppy and
      randomized style quite alien to the meticulous artistry of  Middle Byzantine
      masons. \n\nI&#039;m not sure if all that rubble stone now adorning the front
      is the standard &lt;i&gt;poros&lt;/i&gt;\u2014marly Pliocene limestone quarried
      in Piraeus and Megara. But it looks as though the ashlar of the lovely and better-preserved
      Athenian-style dome is in fact the genuine article. \n\nAlso preserved in the
      dome&#039;s drum is the standard cloisonn\xE9 masonry technique, where the blocks
      of the pitted, fosiliferous carbonate rock are separated with thin red brick.
      And speaking of brick: there&#039;s all that characteristic archwork in that
      medium, too.  \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this

      we can&#039;t really discern the subtle, fine-grained texture of the Permian-period
      Narragansett Pier Granite used throughout this lofty and ornate monument.  But
      we do have a much finer view of the three allegorical female figures perched
      on its upper surfaces.\n\nWhen it comes to this ensemble of symbol-laden ladies,
      the old salt in me feels an instinctive preference for the one clutching an
      anchor. But of course the most dramatic of the bunch is the standing and more
      fully illuminated woman gesturing heavenward. Note the cross she carries in
      her left hand. It&#039;s festooned with Easter Lilies (&lt;i&gt;Lilium longiflorum&lt;/i&gt;),
      plants that have long served as a Christian emblem of the Resurrection.  \n\nThe
      graveyard botany doesn&#039;t stop there, however. As noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53250733547/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      previous photo of this set&lt;/a&gt;, the rich green foliage of a mature Red
      Oak (&lt;i&gt;Quercus rubra&lt;/i&gt;) provides an effective backdrop. \n\nFor
      more on the geologic origins of the Narragansett Pier, click the Part 14 link
      in the preceding paragraph. Subsequent close-ups of this stone will reveal its
      mineralogical makeup.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To learn much more about this site and 200

      the rocky debris on the floor of the intermittent Blue Creek, in Tuff Canyon.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIn
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53249755023/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      previous photo of this series&lt;/a&gt; I pointed out what I think is a &lt;i&gt;lahar&lt;/i&gt;
      (volcanic mudflow) deposit in the canyon&#039;s lower wall. And I surmise that
      the detached chunk of stone shown here may have come from such a bed.\n\nI was
      once told by some instructor or fellow geologist that lahars can often be identified
      by a greater density of large rock fragments than is normally found in air falls
      found adjacent to them. This makes eminent sense to me, given the considerable
      hefting power of a mudflow coursing down a slope or stream channel. But in this
      case I stand ready to be corrected by anyone with a better grasp of igneous
      petrology and lithology than I. Alas, I was born in Illinois, not Iceland.\n\nAt
      any rate, this boulder, whose true size is indicated by the Sharpie pen artfully
      placed atop it for scale, is worthy of a little scrutiny. Whether it originated
      in a lahar flow or not, there&#039;s no doubting that it&#039;s a &lt;i&gt;breccia&lt;/i&gt;
      rather than a plain old conglomerate. This because its clasts (component rock
      fragments) are mostly angular rather than quite rounded. \n\nThe darkest of
      its fragments are almost certainly Oligocene-epoch Bee Mountain Basalt, the
      unit also found cropping out at the base of the canyon cliffs. The gray to olive-weathering
      chunks may be another lava type, trachyandesite, or possibly ash-fall tuff.\n\nSome
      of the other, smaller rocks in this shot appear to be porphyritic specimens
      of various igneous types, with larger crystals (&lt;i&gt;phenocrysts&lt;/i&gt;)
      set in a much finer groundmass. And there are some notable lumps of black and
      apparently aphanitic basalt. \n\n&lt;b&gt;My other photos and descriptions in

      wee portion of the building&#039;s western elevation. At last I&#039;ve made
      direct tactile contact with this famous Prairie School edifice.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nArchitect
      Frank Lloyd Wright, who had a penchant for designing really snazzy Nineteen-Fifties
      houses in the Nineteen-Aughts, here chose a premium-quality building material
      manufactured to his exacting specifications, in what was then the Midwest&#039;s
      greatest brick production center: St. Louis, Missouri. In fact, FLW actually
      traveled to that great river city, no doubt at Mr. Robie&#039;s expense, to
      make sure he got exactly what he wanted. \n\nAnd what he wanted was long-and-low
      Roman Brick that measured 11-5/8 x 4 x 1-5/8 in (29.5 x 10.2 x 4.1 cm) and featured,
      in addition to its rich-red base color, copious silver-gray flecking. The latter
      was produced by firing the bricks at an especially high kiln temperature that
      encouraged their clay&#039;s   iron content to migrate to the surface and congeal
      there.   \n\nClay for common-variety St. Louis Brick came from the city&#039;s
      abundant Pleistocene-epoch deposits of &lt;i&gt;loess&lt;/i&gt; (windblown,
      glacially derived silt) that mantles the Mississippi River bluff. However, facing-quality
      brick such as the Robie&#039;s was made from the Cheltenham Clay, a Pennsylvanian-subperiod
      (Upper Carboniferous) coal-swamp underclay (&lt;i&gt;paleosol&lt;/i&gt;, or
      ancient soil) mined in shafts under the city.       \n\nOnce this special consignment
      of Roman, St. Louis, iron-flecked bricks arrived on site, Wright directed his
      masons to lay them in two different mortars: \n\n- a normal buff-colored type
      for the horizontal joints, carefully raked out to enhance shadowing, and \n\n-
      a red mixture for the vertical joints that blended so well with the brick itself
      that even from a close distance the viewer sees not individual units of fired
      clay but continuous stripes, akin to the flat-lying sedimentary strata of  northern
      Illinois and southern Wisconsin.\n\nThe result of all is that the Robie House&#039;s
      profound sense of horizontality is intensified even more. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For much
      more on this site and 200 others in the Windy City, see my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago
      in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;, described at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..&quot;

      at the main portal, situated at the northwestern corner of this church-turned-museum.&lt;/i&gt;
      \n\nAs I noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53187912844/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      21 of this series&lt;/a&gt;, I&#039;m not sure whether this elaborately ornamented,
      Gothic-style pointed archway is a later add-on, but I assume it is, for reasons
      already discussed in the earlier description. At any rate, the amount of carved
      detail in what I take to be the Segovia Sandstone is impressive and fascinating
      to scrutinize.\n\nRegarding the angelic painting of the tympanum, I can&#039;t
      quite tell from modern imagery whether it&#039;s still there. To my untutored
      eye, its seraphim (?) fluttering about the Godhead certainly look Romanesque
      or Gothic, or at least Romanesque-ish or Gothic-ish.\n\nThe Segovia Sandstone
      that gives San Juan and the city&#039;s later churches such a distinctive look
      dates to the waning phase of the Cretaceous period. Having just digested a hefty
      compendium of technical papers on the stratigraphy and tectonic history of Spain,
      I can say that this handsome golden-toned rock unit was deposited on the flank
      of the Iberian Peninsula&#039;s Central Range, which includes the nearby Guadarrama
      Mountains. \n\nThe Central Range is largely composed of granitoid plutons injected
      into the upper crust during the end-of-the-Paleozoic Variscan Orogeny. This
      enduring igneous rock, including the Guadarrama Granite visible today in &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52875633471/in/album-72177720307451632/&quot;&gt;the
      Segovia Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt;, was subsequently uplifted during the next crust-compressing,
      mountain-building episode, the Alpine Orogeny, which began in the Upper Cretaceous.
      \  \n\nAt about the same time, the Segovia Sandstone came into being as part
      of a transgressive sequence of shallow-water (intertidal to lagoonal) sedimentary
      strata deposited on a carbonate platform. These strata also included limestone
      and dolostone. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this

      section of the facade (western elevation).&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIn this final shot of
      the Dodge House, I&#039;ve chosen one spot on the exterior that is quite representative
      of all of the cobblework. I&#039;m not sure why, but I find the not-so-simple
      artfulness of the place mesmerizing.\n\nI think it&#039;s the combination of
      the stones, so carefully segregated by geologic type, and the little mortar
      boxes that hold them as though they&#039;re accessioned museum specimens lying
      in a cabinet tray. There are the black Mesoproterozoic basalts, emissaries from
      the cataclysmic Midcontinent Rift event; the even older pink and gray granitoids
      of North America&#039;s ancient core; the Silurian dolostones, at 425 Ma the
      youngsters of the lot.   \n\nIf you peer at these long enough, you&#039;ll sense
      that for all their implied tidiness there&#039;s actually a lot of tomfoolery
      going on. One sees this in the relentless regularity of various irregularities:
      in the differing thicknesses of dark, medium, and light bands, and in what angle
      the cobbles of each course are set. \n\nAny attempt to find a grand repeating
      pattern leads to madness. However meticulous the Dodges meant to be, they expressed
      something quite amazingly subconscious, a kind of architectural Ouija-board
      message in letters of stone. But to understand exactly what I mean by this,
      you really have to see the place for yourself. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To peruse the other

      &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53237534859/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      11&lt;/a&gt;, displays my lack of good sense in that it was taken in the middle
      of North Clark Street, a place where absentminded photographic pedestrians normally
      should not stand.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhile the viewer&#039;s eye is naturally drawn
      to all that sumptuous, Egyptianate terra-cotta on the ground floor (and in those
      snazzy window surrounds on the second level as well), I now focus on the much
      plainer upper facade. In future shots of this series I&#039;ll return to the
      Northwestern Terra Cotta Company artistry below\u2014including the arrestingly
      olive-green pharaohs that flank the main entrance.\n\nThe reason the stuff above
      is worthy of mention is that it is, unless I&#039;m cruelly mistaken, white
      &lt;i&gt;glazed&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;enameled brick&lt;/i&gt;. These types
      of glossy-coated bricking are venerable forms of architectural ornamentation
      in their own right. \n\nThe glazed  variety was used at least as far back as
      the ancient Babylonians (e. g., in their city&#039;s magnificent Ishtar Gate,
      of the sixth century BC). The enameled kind, on the other hand, was pioneered
      in the American Middle West by the Tiffany Company of Momence, Illinois. At
      first it was used primarily for interior hallways, bathrooms, and to provide
      highly reflective walls for office-building light wells. But then it caught
      on, at just about the beginning of the twentieth century, as decorative facade
      cladding, too.\n\nWhether the bricks here are enameled (with the outer coating
      agent fused by very high kiln heat into the brick itself) or just glazed (with
      an unfused coat that sits outside the brick), they&#039;re remarkably like architectural
      terra-cotta in their ability to be washed and maintained easily.\n\nAnother
      bit of interest in the Reebie Warehouse&#039;s glazed or enameled bricks is
      that they&#039;re set in a pattern known as &lt;i&gt;running bond&lt;/i&gt;.
      In this arrangement, one of the most frequently used by masons, all the bricks
      are set as &lt;i&gt;stretchers&lt;/i&gt; (with their long sides exposed to view).
      And each stretcher of one course (row) is centered directly above the joint
      between two stretchers of the course directly below.\n\nIn many other bonds,
      &lt;i&gt;headers&lt;/i&gt; (short brick ends) also make an appearance in one
      way or another. But the running bond, as you can see here, is absolutely headerless.

      perspective, it&#039;s one thing to walk around the narrow roof of the Natural
      Bridge when all alone, and quite another to herd a gaggle of tour participants
      across it. Half of the group are birdwatchers obsessed with a chickadee on a
      distant tree branch; the others are the daredevil type too damned curious about
      what lies over the edge. A misdirected step and unintended nose-dive into the
      boulders below are all too imaginable.\n\nBut then it&#039;s time for the guide
      to do some diaphragmatic breathing, and just relax. After all, everyone is enjoying
      the lovely spring day, and overtly grateful that you&#039;ve brought them here.
      And besides, they&#039;ve all signed waivers releasing you from personal liability.\n\nAs
      it turns out, those waivers were probably not worth the paper they were printed
      on. Still, here you are years later, basking in the memory that you lost no
      one and killed no one and didn&#039;t even have a single sprained ankle on all
      of those trips to darken your name.\n\nAnd now, peering at this one moment frozen
      in time, you can turn your attention to an appreciation of nature shorn of all
      responsibility. You can meditate on the old fork-trunked ash tree, the same
      one shown from below in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/&quot;&gt;Part
      1&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can ponder the moss-and-lichen-dappled Pounds Sandstone,
      which 320 Ma before had been a stream deposit in another, much earlier bedrock
      canyon.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this beautiful and geologically fascinating
      locale, get a copy of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Geology

      toward one section of the courthouse&#039;s eastern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis
      portion of this Richardsonian Romanesque building reminds me powerfully of the
      arcaded porches of the original version of the Romanesque style, as articulated
      in the churches of Segovia, Spain. Here&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53042100663/in/album-72177720307451632/&quot;&gt;one
      example of that&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nThe three main exterior building materials, all
      products of Wisconsin, are visible in this shot, though the richly red Maiden
      Rock Brick here takes a back seat to the great mass of Regional Silurian Dolostone.
      Note the striking checkerboard masonry of widely spaced ashlar blocks under
      the columns. It almost looks like a wind baffle. At any rate, the masons who
      set the stone must have had tremendous fun with all the different patterns they
      got to play with.  \n\nAs I noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53212741652/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      Part 10 description&lt;/a&gt;, I&#039;m guessing that the buff-to-buttery-yellow
      ashlar is specifically Wauwatosa Dolostone, quarried in the Menomonee River
      Valley just west of Milwaukee. If it isn&#039;t, though, it comes from another
      locality in the eastern portion of the Badger State.\n\nAnd then there are those
      beautiful gleaming column shafts of Montello Granite. This intrusive igneous
      rock was a costly and  premium-grade selection. Paleoproterozoic in age, it
      has an unusually high quartz content that made it devilishly difficult to cut,
      shape, and polish. But when all that extra effort was taken, the result was
      what may well be the most enduring of all building and monumental stones. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      Taken from the palace&#039;s entrance.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThroughout this set showing
      this splendid building in its former ruinous state, I have made reference to
      a flock of free-range chickens who accompanied me on my exploration of this
      roofless hulk. \n\nHere, at long last, they make an appearance, pecking away
      in the middle ground. And to their left, there&#039;s also a free-range rooster
      perched on the lowest course of ashlar of the Blachernae Walls. He looks like
      a road-crew foreman, standing around idly and telling everyone else what to
      do.\n\nIf you now visit the fully restored building, which serves as the Tekfur
      Saray\u0131 Museum, you probably won&#039;t have fine feathered tour guides.
      But you&#039;ll still behold all that lovely Late Byzantine masonry, with its
      combination of locally quarried, Miocene Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone and contrasting
      belt courses of red brick. To see it at its best, at least as I saw it half
      a century ago, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53116995519/in/album-72177720303792872/&quot;&gt;Part
      1&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nAnd I should also note that the column appearing as a dark
      silhouette in this frame still stands, along with one other. From more modern
      imagery I gather their shafts at least are handsome, veined Proconnesian Marble.
      That premium building material of the emperors and sultans was quarried on Marmara
      Island, in the Sea of Marmara, about 115 km (ca. 70 mi) to the southwest of
      here. \n\nThe Proconnesian&#039;s &lt;i&gt;protolith&lt;/i&gt; (original, unmetamorphosed
      rock type) was limestone laid down in the Precambrian or early Paleozoic era.
      Much later, it was transformed into its present form in the Permian period,
      during the Variscan Orogeny. For what it&#039;s worth, that far-ranging mountain-building
      event also triggered the emplacement of various bodies of granitic magma in
      what is now the northern part of the Mediterranean Basin\u2014 including that
      which ultimately supplied the Romans with the stone for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52813376590/in/album-72177720307451632/&quot;&gt;the
      magnificent aqueduct in Segovia, Spain&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nWhile this concludes my
      various sets on buildings of Istanbul/Constantinople as seen on land, I&#039;ll
      later post some additional photos from the transits I made from the Dardanelles
      to the Black Sea, and back again.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      at the cathedral&#039;s facade (western elevation).&lt;/i&gt;\n\nHere St. Sava&#039;s
      three main, geologically derived exterior building materials are on full display:\n\n-
      The random-coursed, rock-faced, and variably toned Fond du Lac Dolostone, a
      relatively rare but fine member of the Regional Silurian Dolostone family.\n\n-
      The Mississippian-subperiod (Lower Carboniferous) Salem Limestone of the columns,
      arches and trim. Architects invariably call this minutely fossiliferous calcarenite
      &amp;quot;Bedford Stone&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Indiana Limestone&amp;quot; instead.\n\n-
      The nicely patined copper of the dome roofs. \n\nWhat a classy combination.\n\nAll
      the fancy sculptural detail and inscription work has been done in the Salem\u2014one
      of this planet&#039;s most carvable rock types. But it is the Fond du Lac, quarried
      near the eponymous Wisconsin city, that gives this Byzantine Revival house of
      worship its striking texture and visual interest.\n\n&lt;b&gt;This site, and
      many others in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming

      this, our final view from the Mycenaean citadel, most of the green and fertile
      floor of the Argos Graben is obscured in a rain haze made opalescent by the
      returning sunshine.  \n\nStill, there&#039;s plenty to look at. Besides the
      foreground rocks of the battlement wall (Pliocene-to-Pleistocene Mycenae Conglomerate,
      Triassic-to-Jurassic Mycenae Limestone, or both), there&#039;s the exposed and
      very stony brown soil of the slope below and the wet and highly reflective surface
      of the archaeological site&#039;s access road. \n\nAnd just beyond the road,
      where there&#039;s that little curving hook of a driveway, is our final stop
      in this series. It&#039;s the so-called Treasury of Atreus, or the Tomb of Agamemnon,
      if you prefer to engage in some Schliemannesque romanticism (though that version
      of the name is not really credited to old Heinrich).\n\nIn fact, it&#039;s a
      magnificent, rock-ribbed tholos tomb of an unknown person or persons. If you
      look closely, you can see the top of its long, narrow entrance marching most
      of the way up its small ridge. \n\nMore on its splendid masonry in the concluding
      two photos in this set!\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      the western elevation is to the left; the southern elevation to the right.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhat
      is all too corporeal in this frame is the flagrant soft-drink billboard, now
      blissfully absent. One can only wonder what the eleventh-century mind (or palate)
      would have made of that splendid product. But I&#039;ll refrain from any reveries
      on the jarring juxtaposition here of medieval and modern, the sacred and the
      profane, and so on.\n\nWhile it may lack some of the architectural fine points
      of its near-contemporaries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53168957021/in/album-72177720303792872/&quot;&gt;the

      Daphni Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, Incorporeal Angels is an absolute sweet pea illustrating
      with admirable simplicity Middle Byzantine masonry techniques and materials
      at least as well as any other site in Attica.\n\nOnce again, the ashlar appears
      to be the soft, pitted, fossiliferous &lt;i&gt;poros&lt;/i&gt; of Pliocene age.
      It&#039;s a marly limestone  quarried in such locales as Megara and Piraeus.\n\nAnd
      then again there&#039;s the cloisonn\xE9 technique of placing very thin bricks
      as spacers between the stone blocks. And the typical brick arches, and the terra-cotta
      roofing tiles, with the arched &lt;i&gt;kalupter&lt;/i&gt; sections alternating
      with the flat &lt;i&gt;solenes&lt;/i&gt; pieces. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other

      female figures were a standard trope of the Victorian-era monumental trade,
      and practically every American cemetery of a certain size and age has its share
      of these classically garbed ladies grieving, symbolizing birth and motherhood,
      representing one profession or another, pointing heavenward, or pensively pondering
      eternity, \n\nThe Hoyt Monument is notable because it sports a whole trio of
      such figures, nicely framed at this time of year by the spreading crown of a
      native Red Oak (&lt;i&gt;Quercus rubra&lt;/i&gt;). \n\nAs succeeding close-ups
      will demonstrate, all of these sculptures and their accompanying ornamerntation
      look as clean-edged and unweathered as they day they were carved 140 years ago.
      Why? Well, for one thing, they&#039;re made of one of the greatest and most
      enduring of American monumental stones, the Narragansett Pier Granite.\n\nQuarried
      in the lovely Rhode Island town of Westerly, which I featured for botanical
      reasons in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52290633179/in/album-72177720301296710/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plant
      Explorer&#039;s Guide to New England&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Narragansett Pier
      is a fine- and tight-grained intrusive igneous rock marketed unsurprisingly
      as &amp;quot;Westerly Granite.&amp;quot; The specific variety used here was
      &amp;quot;Blue Westerly.&amp;quot; (Stone-trade people are forever hyping pale-gray
      rock types as being blue, especially those that are not warm-toned enough to
      be buff or slightly pink.)\n\nPermian in age, the Narragansett Pier formed in
      masses of magma injected into the upper crust during the latter part of Alleghenian
      Orogeny and the assembly of the Pangaean supercontinent, when crustal compression
      was replaced by shearing due to the counterclockwise rotation of southeastern
      New England. It is widely represented in Graceland, Rosehill, Forest Home, and
      other Chicago and Milwaukee cemeteries. During the heyday of its production
      (now sadly ceased), this tough and reliasble stone was a major competitor of
      Vermont&#039;s Barre Granodiorite.\n\nUnfortunately, the very qualities that
      make the Narragansett Pier such a durable selection also make it a trifle boring.
      It lacks the more striking textures and ruddy tones of Wisconsin&#039;s Waupaca,
      Wausau, and Montello alkali-feldspar granites. Or, for that matter, the pleasing
      salt-and-pepper aspect of the Barre. Still, it has been a remarkable performer
      in a brutal continental climate that ofttimes plays havoc with such weak-sister
      varieties as the Shelburne and Carrara Marbles, and the Salem Limestone.   \n\n&lt;b&gt;To
      learn much more about this site and 200 others in the Windy City, make it your
      top personal priority to get a copy of my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago in Stone and

      supplement to this set&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52481615607/in/album-72177720302395234/&quot;&gt;Part
      3&lt;/a&gt;, which shows large chunks of basalt that went flying through the
      air back in the Oligocene epoch. That was during one of many volcanic eruptions
      that occurred in Trans-Pecos Texas and adjoining Mexico and New Mexico in that
      infernal episode of prehistory.\n\nSuch big rocks, now embedded in the pyroclastic
      deposits exposed on Tuff Canyon&#039;s walls, are called &lt;i&gt;ballistic
      blocks&lt;/i&gt;, no doubt because of the trajectories they described during
      their brief airborne phase. \n\nBallistic blocks can be distinguished from other
      big stone fragments carried directly along within pyroclastic flows by the &lt;i&gt;impact
      sag&lt;/i&gt; zones located under them. I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; I&#039;m
      seeing one of those depressions under the bigger black boulder in this image,
      but it may be wishful thinking. \n\nAt any rate, this big chunk of Bee Mountain
      Basalt seems to be sitting in a coarse-textured bed more characteristic of a
      &lt;i&gt;lahar&lt;/i&gt; (water-lubricated debris flow) than of a pyroclastic
      surge or flow. Lahar deposits definitely exist at this site, and I&#039;ll show
      another example of one in a photo to follow. \n\nRegardless of whether this
      shot shows true ballistic blocks or not, the fact remains that there are quite
      a few others nearby that unequivocaly are. As I walked about during my visit
      here and saw how many of these lithic projectiles are visible in this relatively
      small cross-section of the volcanic material that blankets this locale, I became
      morbidly fascinated with what it must have been like to actually be on the receiving
      end of this hailstorm from hell. \n\nYears before, I&#039;d been on one active
      volcano (Stromboli) where globs of lava and hot rock were falling nearby, and
      on one other (Etna) where the same had happened a day or two before I got there,
      and there were freshly minted volcanic bombs lying around everywhere. But the
      eruption that hefted Tuff Canyon&#039;s arsenal of mafic missiles would have
      been orders of magnitude more powerful.  \n\nAfter poring over this photo for
      quite a while, I&#039;d like to think that its two boulders are indeed ballistic
      blocks that landed ker-splat into a still-viscous lahar. Either that, or they
      landed first and were then glommed over and buried by that rocky glop.    \n\n&lt;b&gt;My

      portion of the southern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nHere the basic building blocks
      that Frank Lloyd Wright used to create the Robie&#039;s powerful sense of horizontality
      are on full view. To get a better sense of their overall impact, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53189462917/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      9 of this set&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nIn this shot, however, we can best comprehend the
      stratigraphic sandwich that the house really is. Those deep-set square windows
      notwithstanding, the components of primary interest are the red, iron-flecked
      Roman Brick manufactured in St. Louis, Missouri, and the paler and more pedestrian
      Salem Limestone that flanks it. \n\nThe Salem, which just happens to be the
      most commonly encountered architectural rock type in the US, is much better
      known in the quarrying and building trades as Bedford Stone or Indiana Limestone.
      As I say in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52286670650/in/album-72177720301296710/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chicago
      in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:\n\n&lt;i&gt;Once the urban explorer learns
      to recognize the Salem, it\u2019s a constant companion through life, at least
      if one stays in America. In the heart of every city, in each of its suburbs,
      in one-stop-sign towns halfway to Santa Fe, there is always some of this utterly
      unassuming stone lurking. It\u2019s in the official face of the shoebox post
      office, on the Gothic ramparts of the local high school, in the lintels and
      window trim of the side-street Methodist church.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAnd it&#039;s
      on some of the most architecturally distinguished buildings, too. Dating to
      the Mississippian subperiod (Lower Carboniferous), the Salem may seem unremittingly
      bland at a distance, but closer up it often reveals fascinating details. I&#039;ll
      address these in another close-up to follow.\n\nAt this range, what I noted
      in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52353519986/in/album-72177720302658037/&quot;&gt;Part
      10&lt;/a&gt; about Wright&#039;s clever manipulation of mortar\u2014white in
      the horizontal joints and red in the vertical, to accentuate the sense of unbroken
      strata\u2014is more apparent. \n\nThe one beef I have with Wright&#039;s Robie&#039;s
      design is that he, like many a heedless architect before and after him, allowed
      the Salem to extend down to grade. Often, when it comes into contact with the
      ground, and especially sidewalks, this porous rock will absorb meltwater and
      its dissolved deicer salts. The latter can wreak havock later on, in the form
      of efflorescence crusts and the case-hardening and breakdown of the rock itself.
      \n\nBut in this spot at least FLW&#039;s luck seems to have held. The only noticeable
      change to the stone&#039;s surface, besides a few scuffs, is the growth of some
      calciphilic algae.  \n\n&lt;b&gt;For much more on this site and 200 others in

      eastward, at this former church&#039;s southern elevation and bell tower.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhat
      I take to be this building&#039;s main exterior material, the Late Cretaceous
      Segovia Sandstone, is complemented in the upper tier of tower windows with red
      brick of unknown date. In those  rather non-Romanesque ogee arches that brick
      seems to be present in quite a range of sizes, and is quite reminiscent of ancient
      Roman brickwork used in the same capacity.\n\nOne aspect of this photo that
      puzzles me a bit is the quite uniform white band atop the blue portion of the
      sky. It may be the straightest-edged bottom of a cloud I&#039;ve ever seen.
      Or perhaps it&#039;s just a zone of the original slide that faded with remarkable
      uniformity. But if so, why was the tower&#039;s weathervane protruding into
      the white layer unaffected? \n\nIn my final shot of San Juan, which will follow,
      I&#039;ll focus on the larger significance of the time in which the Segovia
      Sandstone was deposited. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      height_l=\"768\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Looking at the
      southern side of the southwestern corner. For a good overall view of this elevation,
      see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53162290218/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIt&#039;s obvious that Elizabeth and Edward Dodge
      were both artful and geologically astute when they arranged these Lake Michigan
      cobbles in their fancily ridged lime mortar.\n\nBut first, the quoin ashlar.
      It&#039;s highly fosssiliferous and reefal Regional Silurian Dolostone, most
      likely from a quarry a few miles away in Knellsville, Grafton, or Cedarburg.
      Visible here are shell molds and casts of brachiopods, bivalves, or both, and
      probably other invertebrate marine critters are represented as well. \n\nThis
      rock type formed on the edge of the developing crustal downwarp known as the
      Michigan Basin, in shallow, subtropical saltwater. This was at a time when this
      part of Laurentia, North America&#039;s Proterozoic-to-Early-Paleozoic predecessor,
      \ was situated about 30 degrees south of the equator (in contrast to its current
      position, 43 degrees North).  \n\nAs far as the cobbles go, the Dodges lined
      them up, in what appears at this scale to be an attractive but noncyclical way,
      as follows:\n\n- BLACK: mostly Late Mesoproterozoic basalts erupted during the
      Midcontinent Rift event about 1.1 Ga ago; probably from Upper Michigan&#039;s
      Keweenaw Peninsula. Also some gabbro from the same time and area, or a very
      dark-gray granitoid from the Canadian Shield.\n\n- GRAY OR PINK, AND SPECKLED:
      Paleoproterozoic to Archean granitoids from the Canadian Shield. Northern Wisconsin,
      Upper Michigan, or Ontario.\n\n- BONE-WHITE TO BUFF: More Regional Silurian
      Dolostone, from a  more northern locale in eastern Wisconsin or Upper Michigan.
      Some of it seems reefal; some, interreefal and devoid of fossils. (On second
      glance, I do also see a mold of a narrow-conic snail shell. I&#039;ll have to
      look up its genus.)\n\nAll of these rocks were first transported south from
      their outcrop locations by a Wisconsin-stage ice sheet late in the Pleistocene
      ice age. Then they were jostled, caressed, and tumbled into more ovoid or spheroidal
      forms by the lake surf.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      fool reason, in the middle of Clark Street. This is one of the North Side&#039;s
      busiest thoroughfares, and I&#039;m probably lucky I wasn&#039;t run over, or
      at least the subject of some furious ankhing&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nAt this range some
      of the details of the lower facade&#039;s Egyptianate motifs are more apparent.
      Up above the stout columns are scarab medallions and powder-blue and brick-red
      winged emblems of Amon Ra, god of the noonday sun. \n\nAll this and the white,
      coursed cladding were produced by the artisans of the Northwestern Terra Cotta
      Company. That famous firm was situated about twenty blocks west of here, on
      the near bank of the Chicago River&#039;s North Branch. \n\nWhile the manufacturers
      of the city&#039;s Chicago Common Brick usually relied on the clays of local
      glacial-till deposits, Northwestern needed higher-grade base material free of
      pebbles and other impurities. Consequently, it depended on large quantities
      of Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) underclays and marine shales shipped
      in by rail from Illinois Basin coal mines.\n\nTo the miners themselves, the
      underclays were just a waste product; to the Northwestern crew, the stuff of
      high art. But to geologists and paleontologists, they&#039;re something else
      again\u2014the &lt;i&gt;paleosols&lt;/i&gt; or ancient soils in which the giant
      free-sporing scale trees of Pangaean swamp forests had grown some 300 Ma ago.

      sunlit, early-April day, when the leaf buds were just beginning to break.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe
      last I checked, there were two ways to get onto the top of the Natural Bridge:
      \n\n-the direct method involving a set of ancient-looking and in some cases
      disconcertingly loosely anchored metal ladder rungs on the vertical face of
      the Pounds Sandstone; and\n\n- a much more circuitous route via a footpath that
      mounts the bluff more gradually some distance away.\n\nWhen I&#039;ve led tour
      groups here, the latter approach has really been the only option, given that
      some participants are hardly orangutans in the brachiation department. And the
      longer, more leisurely stroll also gives everyone a chance to see the canyon&#039;s
      various botanical wonders. \n\nOne of these wonders is the &amp;quot;lichen
      gardens&amp;quot; (&lt;i&gt;Cladonia&lt;/i&gt; spp. primarily), that have established
      themselves all over the place in the thin, sandy, clifftop substrate. Some of
      these mini-ecosystems can be spotted in the background, as the very-light-green
      patches under the trees on the far side of the stone ramp. Note that even the
      ramp itself hosts quite a selection of lichen, moss, and algal communities.
      \ \n\nAnd looking down at the visible portion of the Bridge&#039;s vertical
      face, it&#039;s possible to see some thin crossbeds exposed in this Lower Pennsylvanian
      (Upper Carboniferous), fluvially deposited sandstone. For a better look at this
      characteristic sedimentary feature in the Pounds, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53181572895/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      3 of this set&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nWhile we&#039;re at it, we might as well be a trifle
      dendrological, as well. The large tree with the exfoliating bark to the left
      is an American Sycamore (&lt;i&gt;Platanus occidentalis&lt;/i&gt;). This, our
      native plane species, can grow to beastly sizes in the Land of Lincoln\u2014especially
      in bottomlands along the Illinois and Wabash Rivers. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on

      facing eastward, but this time we&#039;re looking at closer range, at the lower
      portion of the western elevation.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nOf the exterior building materials
      on view here, two are fully documented. And the third, the  pale-buff, rock-faced
      ashlar, can be identified in a general sort of way with a high degree of confidence.
      It&#039;s almost certainly Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) from the eastern
      side of Wisconsin. \n\nMy guess is that it is specifically the RSD variety I
      call the Wauwatosa Dolostone, quarried in the Menomonee River Valley just west
      of Milwaukee. I know it was definitely used for one of the campus halls of Beloit
      College, not that far from here. However, rock virtually indistinguishable from
      this was also produced in other communities in the greater Cream City area.\n\nIn
      any event, this close carbonate cousin of true limestone was deposited some
      425 Ma ago in shallow, reef-studded waters on the western fringe of the great
      crustal downwarp known as the Michigan Basin.\n\nOn this exterior, the Wauwatosa
      (or whatever) provides a dramatic contrast to the ruddier tones of the Maiden
      Rock Brick and the Paleoproterozoic-era Montello Granite of the pillar shafts.

      feature at Cape Perpetua on the Oregon coast.  The well is the result of the
      collapse of the roof of a sea cave.  It is approximately 18 feet wide and 20
      feet deep.  The dog accompanying the man taking shots of the well has had enough!
      \ I didn&#039;t go down to the edge as I am clumsy enough on flat ground, much
      less on uneven, slippery basalt with waves surging around. Plus, the spray is
      intense.  I value my life and my cameras more than the excitement of getting
      close.</description>\n\t</photo>\n\t<photo id=\"53209055865\" owner=\"196253572@N05\"

      remained of its western wall, but I&#039;m not sure.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAs forlorn
      and even postapocalyptic as this photo seems, it shows more detail of the building&#039;s
      once-beautiful masonry. Obviously there have been modifications and patching
      with newer ashlar blocks over the centuries, but at the very least the older
      stuff is the Miocene-epoch Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone. And some of the original
      red-brick belt coursing is still there, too.  \n\nI&#039;d love to find out
      if the surviving timber beam remnants so prominently visible here were original
      as well. And what tree species were they cut from? I could speculate that they
      were some sort of native oak, but idle speculation is often worse than worthless.
      I&#039;ll continue to investigate.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      at the building&#039;s facade (southern elevation) as well as its western side.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAn
      arresting m\xE9lange of three not always reconcilable architectural styles\u2014Richardsonian
      Romanesque, Second Empire, and Renaissance Revival\u2014Old City Hall as restored
      is quite the colorful Yooper showboat. (And in case you don&#039;t already know,
      Yooper = a resident of the UP = the Upper Peninsula.) \n\nGiven its maroons
      and reds and pinks, it should by rights be the City Hall of Helium, Mars, and
      one could easily imagine Dejah Thoris and John Carter striking a pose in front
      of its main entrance. But then the redness fits here, too, because Marquette
      was one of North America&#039;s great brownstone production centers when this
      edifice was erected.\n\nIt always warms the cockles of my heart when I learn
      that a community&#039;s elders or its &lt;i&gt;vox populi&lt;/i&gt; insisted
      on their new municipal building being made of local materials. And such was
      the case here. While I don&#039;t know the story behind the roofing tiles, I&#039;ve
      discovered that the ashlar, the Jacobsville Sandstone variety of Lake Superior
      Brownstone, was extracted just south of town, in what seems to have been Marquette&#039;s
      main quarrying district.\n\nThe other main building material, which I henceforth
      christen Marquette Brick, was also manufactured nearby. I need to find out what
      its source material was\u2014glacial till? some hematite-rich shale deposited
      along with the Jacobsville atop the lava flows of the Midcontinent Rift?  So
      far this is my one documented use of this brick type, though I&#039;m sure there
      are various others.\n\nThe Marquette brand of the Jacobsville, on the other
      hand, was definitely exported far and wide, and in this photo set I&#039;ve
      described and will continue to describe its uses in other cities. For example,
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52713964938/in/album-72177720306314298/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      end of our track, along the Boquillas Canyon Trail. We are on high ground, not
      far from the trailhead parking lot, and we&#039;re looking south-southwestward.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nBefore
      entering the vertiginous, awe-inspiring landscape of Boquillas Canyon proper,
      it&#039;s only fitting that we take a look at the twists and turns of the Rio
      Grande a bit upstream, in less dramatic terrain. Besides the point bars and
      the floodplain plant communities there are the low erosional landforms on the
      far, Mexican side of the river. \n\nJust to the left of this frame rises the
      massive, fault-scarped rampart of the Sierra del Carmen, famed for its sunset
      colors, and the great notch of the canyon&#039;s mouth. Before venturing in
      among the cliffs and hoodoos of Lower Cretaceous limestone, we&#039;ll take
      a look at one of this national park&#039;s weirdest and most striking plants,
      a member of a family usually found in wetter, tropical climes. That&#039;s next.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      between Grave Circle A and the lip of the great wall of Mycenae&#039;s citadel
      (acropolis). Looking southwestward at outer excavations, the site access road,
      and the parking lot. Beyond lies the valley of the Argos Graben, wrapped in
      haze&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nThe rectangular-chambered ruin complex in the middle ground
      is the so-called Oil-Merchant&#039;s House Group, sometimes rendered as the
      Oil-Trader&#039;s House instead. It reportedly dates to the 13th century BC,
      as does much of the works above it.\n\nAt this range it&#039;s difficult to
      tell if the surviving wall segments were constructed of Mycenae Limestone (Upper
      Triassic to  Middle Jurassic, quarried on surrounding hills) or the Pliocene-to-Pleistocene
      Mycenae Conglomerate obtained on the floor of the graben below. Probably there&#039;s
      some of both, as is often the case here.\n\nThere&#039;s also a nice cut of
      limestone-derived&lt;i&gt;terra rossa&lt;/i&gt; soil horizon on the far side
      of the roadway. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this

      through a narrow cataract that drops 61 m (200 ft) into a bowl formed in the
      canyon which is 115 m (377 ft) deep. Exposing a large cross-section of the Columbia
      River Basalt Group, the current moves swiftly through a winding gorge of columnar
      basalt, to its southern end at the mighty Snake River.\nCarved more than 13,000
      years ago, Palouse Falls is among the last active waterfalls on the Ice Age
      floods path. At the end of the last ice age, repeated glacial floods known as
      the Missoula Floods, swept across eastern Washington carving out the unique
      scablands landscape we see today. \nThis natural wonder was named Washington\u2019s
      state waterfall in 2014, when the state legislature passed a bill written by
      elementary school students in the nearby town of Washtucna, who had advocated
      for the designation. It had been dedicated as Palouse Falls State Park on June
      3, 1951.</description>\n\t</photo>\n\t<photo id=\"53195466740\" owner=\"29409244@N03\"

      This is the church&#039;s southern (actually southwestern) elevation, which
      reportedly retains much of the original building&#039;s design and materials.&lt;/i&gt;
      \n\nHoly Trinity, the largest of Athenian Byzantine-era churches, has served
      the city&#039;s Russian Orthodox community since its nineteenth-century rehabilitation
      from its previous ruinous state.\n\nAs much as I love Date Palms (&lt;i&gt;Phoenix
      dactylifera&lt;/i&gt;) and have extolled their use as street trees on my own
      native continent\u2014for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52513127510/in/album-72177720302478879/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
      and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52519784414/in/album-72177720302478879/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;\u2014I
      dearly wish the tree in the middle of this frame had been planted elsewhere.
      \n\nStill, a fair portion of the characteristic Middle-Byzantine cloisonn\xE9
      masonry is visible nonetheless. A quick check on Google Earth confirms that
      all the palms have since been removed, though the garden planting at far left
      has survived.  \n\nInterestingly, Holy Trinity is essentially a three-quarters-size
      replica of the much more famous &lt;i&gt;katholikon&lt;/i&gt; of the Hosios
      Loukas Monastery, built not that long before in the wilds of Boeotia.\n\nRegarding
      this church, I&#039;m forced as usual to speculate about the geologic origins
      of the rough-faced, puckery, and presumably pretty soft ashlar that is set between
      those typically wafer-thin, double-coursed bricks. Sources I&#039;ve consulted
      have much to say about the building&#039;s history, but not about the identity
      of its stone. But the rock does seem to be a dead ringer for &lt;i&gt;poros&lt;/i&gt;\u2014the
      Pliocene-epoch marly and fossiliferous limestone quarried in Megara and Piraeus.\n\nHoly
      Trinity Church is also notable for being dercorated with the kind of pseudo-Kufic
      symbols so strikingly displayed on the contemporary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53128047076/in/album-72177720303792872/&quot;&gt;Holy
      Apostles Church&lt;/a&gt; in the Agora. Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t seem
      to be visible from this image&#039;s vantagepoint. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other

      and looking at the midsection of the Entrance Gate&#039;s eastern side.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAnyone
      familiar with the Windy City&#039;s iconic Water Tower &amp;amp; Pumping Station
      will have no trouble identifying this structure&#039;s architect\u2014William
      C. Boyington. That man certainly had a thing for turrets and castellation. And,
      of course, for Lemont-Joliet Dolostone, the Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD)
      variety so widely used in the city&#039;s formative decades. Here it&#039;s
      present in rock-faced and regular-to-random-coursed form. \n\nWinter is definitely
      the time to see this fine display of carbonate sedimentary rock at its best,
      when it&#039;s not partially obscured with the foliage of vines that have been
      permitted to establish such a substantial toehold here. Note the stone&#039;s
      subtly varying weathering tints that give the Lemont-Joliet and other RSD types
      so much warmth and character. \n\nThe topographic high on which the cemetery
      is located is the Rosehill (or Rose Hill) Spit, an elongated, north-south deposit
      of sand and gravel created by longshore currents approximately 11.5 ka ago,
      during the Calumet highstand of ancestral Lake Chicago.\n\nOriginally this landform
      was dubbed Roe&#039;s Hill, after an early property owner. But in the cemetery&#039;s
      charter papers it was mistakenly listed as the phonetically identical Rose Hill,
      which in latter days has been elided into Rosehill. \n\nThe fact that the plaque
      above Entrance Gate&#039;s archway uses the modern form of the name makes me
      think it is of relatively recent date.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To learn much more about
      this site and 200 others in the Windy City, make it your top personal priority
      to get a copy of my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;, described

      through yellow, crimson, and lavender hills, giving you a close view of the
      incredible popcorn-textured claystone that distinguishes the Painted Hills.
      \nThe colors and hills were formed over 35 million years ago by many volcanic
      eruptions and changing climate patterns. Layers of ash and soil mixed with mineral
      and plant matter, coupled with erosion, formed the hills that we see today.</description>\n\t</photo>\n\t<photo

      harmonious blend of brick and stone is one of Frank Lloyd Wright&#039;s more
      famous Prairie Style designs, and it&#039;s also one of his most geologically
      savvy and significant. It demonstrates the imprint of Midwestern stratigraphy
      on the architect&#039;s mind. \n\nThe flat-lying sedimentary strata of Wright&#039;s
      early stomping grounds, southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois, are elegantly
      restated here in alternating elements of red St. Louis Brick and buff Salem
      Limestone. As succeeding photos will show, Wright and his brickmasons took special
      pains to emphasize the sense of horizontality he&#039;d already seen expressed
      in the regional outcrops.\n\nThe St. Louis Brick, iron-flecked and shaped in
      long, shallow Roman form, was manufactured from the Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous)
      Cheltenham Clay, an ancient soil horizon in which giant coal-swamp trees once
      grew. It was mined directly under that great city on the Mississippi.\n\nThe
      Salem Limestone, better known to architects as &amp;quot;Bedford Stone&amp;quot;
      or &amp;quot;Indiana Limestone,&amp;quot; is the one most prevalent architectural
      rock type in the US. Composed of marine-animal fossil fragments naturally cemented
      together with calcite, it&#039;s Mississippian (Lower Carboniferous) in age.

      height_l=\"684\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Looking northeastward
      at the facade (western elevation) and a portion of the southern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nEven
      when I visited it in 1978, this former house of worship had been a private residence
      for almost three-quarters of a century. Nowadays it serves as the Museo Zuloaga.\n\nSan
      Juan de los Caballeros was the oldest Romanesque structure I saw when I was
      in Segovia. However, those conversant with this architectural style will immediately
      spot one unusual feature here: the great Gothic arch of the entryway. \n\nI
      assume this impressive portal was added at some point after the initial construction;
      the Gothic mode is usually thought to have originated more than a hundred years
      after San Juan was raised. But the descriptions of this specific site I&#039;ve
      found so far do not address this issue\u2014other to note that that section
      of the facade also incorporates remains of an earlier Visigothic (6th century)
      church.\n\nIn any case, it&#039;s evident after checking Google Earth Street
      View that the building has been at least partially renovated since I photographed
      it. For one thing, the badly deteriorated ashlar under the blind arches has,
      I gather, been replaced or reconstituted. My suposition is that it is (or at
      least was) one of the town&#039;s two standard architectural-rock types, the
      Upper Cretaceous Segovia Sandstone. \n\nLooking at the crumbling stonework,
      it reminds me a lot of other case-hardened sandstone I&#039;ve seen elsewhere.
      But, as I keep having to say, provenance is lacking.\n\nAnother change for the
      better one can see today is that the wonderful arched porch colonnades that
      were so indecorously walled up in this image are open again, though the ones
      in front are now backed by decidedly non-Romanesque glass windows.  \n\nI wonder
      if the higher degree of destructive stone weathering I saw at this location
      was at all linked to San Juan&#039;s location, overlooking the north-facing
      cliff of the city&#039;s rocky heights. Or were the masons of the late 11th
      century just less selective in choosing good-quality sandstone than their 12th-
      and 13th-century successors?\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      The porch and main entrance are on the building&#039;s western side; also visible
      is the considerably less altered northern elevation. &lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis vantagepoint
      may not reveal the full impact of the original cobblestone exterior or the complementing
      Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) quoins the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53162290218/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      Part 13 photo&lt;/a&gt; does. But at least it shows the Lannon Dolostone pillars
      and bay-window base of the 1930s addition to good effect. \n\nThe Lannon, a
      RSD variety quarried to this day about 20 mi (32 km) to the southwest of Port
      Washington, is often extracted in thin-bedded, flaggy sections more suitable
      for veneer than real ashlar blocks. Most often it is face-mounted in pieces
      of varying size and shape, in random-course fashion. And so it is here.\n\nOne
      of the most attractive aspects of the Lannon\u2014besides its smaller amount
      of spalling and exfoliation compared to northeastern Illinois&#039; Lemont-Joliet
      variety\u2014is its polychromatic weathering profile. Some sections retain their
      original pale-gray color for decades, whereas others turn warmer tones of buff,
      gold, and even ocher.\n\nIn the shots that follow we&#039;ll focus more fully
      on the Dodge House&#039;s original building materials. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the

      at the warehouse&#039;s southwestern and southeastern elevations.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhat
      at first glance may seem an uninteresting, utilitarian structure is in fact
      one of the Windy City&#039;s most delightful expressions of architectural noncontextuality\u2014a
      concept I&#039;m always willing to admire, praise, and promote. As will become
      apparent in the photos that follow, the Reebie Warehouse boldly dares to relate
      to nothing whatsoever around it, and not even to itself.\n\nTo really appreciate
      the salutary incongruity present here, you need to lower your gaze to the first
      story of the building&#039;s Clark Street facade. It was there that, at the
      request of the original owners, designer George S. Kingsley provided something
      rarely seen in storage warehouses, at least since the Ptolemaic Dynasty: a whopping
      dose of Ancient Egyptian design motifs. \n\nThis remarkable Roaring-Twenties
      riff on pharaonic magnificence, breathtaking in its cognitive dissonance, was
      executed in polychrome terra-cotta crafted twenty blocks to the west, in Chicago&#039;s
      Northwestern works. \n\nNorthwestern&#039;s base material was derived from Pennsylvanian-subperiod
      (Upper Carboniferous) underclays and marine shales unearthed in the bituminous-coal
      mines of the Illinois Basin, and then shipped up to the big city by rail. \n\nThe
      pictures that follow will concentrate, at considerably closer range, on the
      wonderful terra-cotta cladding that was produced from this 300-Ma-old material.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For

      Part 2 photo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis is quite a complicated patchwork of
      shade and sunlight and contrasting colors, all seen through a curtain of water
      droplets falling from the cliff edge above. Still, the strata of the thin-bedded
      Pounds Sandstone are perfectly visible with their well-preserved &lt;i&gt;crossbedding&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nThe
      Pounds, a member of the Lower Pennsylvanian (early Upper Carboniferous) Caseyville
      Formation, was deposited by streams like the  Bell Smith Springs canyon&#039;s
      own modern-day Bay Creek. In other words, they too were incised into older bedrock.
      And the left-to-right direction of their flow is indicated by the slanting crossbeds.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For

      interior focuses on both the Ancient Roman Brick facing and the Ancient Roman
      Concrete exposed above and below it. \n\nThe latter building material is so
      alien to our modern conception of concrete\u2014the smooth-textured Ready Mix
      stuff that&#039;s poured out of a truck and forms something pretty reminiscent
      of compact, slightly sandy limestone\u2014that we think of it as stonemasonry
      instead. And here it does appear to be about 1 part lime-pozzolana mortar to
      9 parts cobbles (or brick fragments or broken tiles, or whatever the exact roster
      of aggregrate ingedients is in this case).\n\nBut how well it worked. When I
      think of all the less-than-a-century-old concrete structures in my own country
      that are in bad need of repair, I have all the more respect for Imperial builders
      and architects who accomplished so much with such rudimentary technology, and
      with so little formal understanding of chemistry and materials science. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For

      My razor-sharp directional sense thereby deduces that we&#039;re looking at
      the building&#039;s western elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIn my humble opinion, one
      of the greatest glories of American architecture is found far from its biggest
      cities, in its nineteenth-century rural county courthouses. And if they happen
      to be constructed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, as here, so much the
      better. \n\nThese distinctive structures are the incarnation of local civic
      pride in the last places in this country where democracy still works. Everything
      about them hearkens back to a very different world. In fact, they&#039;re miniature
      worlds in themselves. Their ceiling-fanned, oak-paneled hallways and clerks&#039;
      offices are populated with warmhearted people named Vern and Darlene, and tend
      to give off a composite scent of Lysol, prairie soil, floor wax, and legal documents
      aged like fine wine in century-old filing cabinets.\n\nThere&#039;s so much
      to explore, inside and out. What&#039;s visible here is an especially impressive
      array of building materials, all obtained, in an admirable display of Badger
      State solidarity, from Wisconsin sources. The Green County Courthouse and adjoining
      Civil War Monument\u2014there always has to be an adjoining Civil War Monument\u2014are
      so geologically rich that I&#039;m going to devote several posts to them. At
      least several.\n\nThe most striking component of the exterior is that luridly
      lovely red brick. It could easily pass for a premium-grade Philadelphia facing
      variety, but according to local documents it actually hails from the Upper-Mississippi-Valley
      hamlet of Maiden Rock, about 250 road mi (402 km) northwest of Monroe. Whether
      its clay was mined from Quaternary deposits laid down by the Father of the Waters,
      I don&#039;t know. This production locality was not cited in any publications
      on Wisconsin brickmaking I&#039;ve come across so far.   \n\nThe contrasting
      yellowish-buff, rock-faced ashlar is described in my sources simply as &amp;quot;limestone.&amp;quot;
      But it&#039;s actually dolostone. For reasons I&#039;ll discuss in future photo
      descriptions, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the locally quarried Plattevile-Galena
      rock of Ordovician age, but rather reefal Regional Silurian Dolostone from Wauwatosa
      or some other place in the eastern section of the state. \n\nAlso on display,
      if just barely, is the ruddy and almost supernaturally hard Montello Granite
      in the shafts of the porch pillars. It formed as part of magma emplacement connected
      with a megavolcanic eruption event in the Paleoproterozoic. But more on that
      anon.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit

      was then the roofless shell of the Palace. I believe we&#039;re facing the junction
      of the western and southern walls, but after all these years I can&#039;t be
      sure.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe heavy growth of moss or some other type of vegetation
      on the vertical surfaces makes the pattern of masonry quite indistinct in places.
      But a little scrutiny reveals that there&#039;s the same alternation of Miocene-epoch
      Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone with horizontal bands of red brick seen in &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53158000485/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      3&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nNone of the free-range fowl who followed me into the ruined
      building are visible in this shot, but they&#039;ll make their appearance in
      a later image. I&#039;d like to think they were inspired by my own geological
      and architectural curiosity. But they, being true to their chicken-brained nature,
      probably just thought I was there to feed them.\n\nSome of the upper window
      arches clearly show the decorative effect of stone alternating with thick-mortared
      bricks. There also seem to be some much more recently added stone or concrete
      blocks farther down. They are of a much more uniform shape than the rest of
      the ashlar. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this series,

      and toward the cathedral&#039;s facade (western elevation) and southern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis
      handsome Neo-Byzantine edifice is one of the most striking and effective twentieth-century
      expressions of Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) I&#039;ve seen. \n\nGeologically
      speaking, St. Sava is particularly distinctive because it&#039;s clad not in
      the usual latter-day RSD selection, Lannon Dolostone, but in very similar rock
      quarried about 40 mi (65 km) farther north, on the southern outskirts of Fond
      du Lac, Wisconsin. \n\nThe Fond du Lac Dolostone on display here is a subtly
      varicolored rock type that, like the Lannon, is shown to its best effect as
      random-coursed, rock-faced cladding. \n\nIn addition, the church exterior features
      portal elements, trim, and window surrounds of light-gray Salem (&amp;quot;Bedford,&amp;quot;
      &amp;quot;Indiana&amp;quot;) Limestone. This Mississippian-subperiod (Lower
      Carboniferous) biocalcarenite is often used as a blander and much more carvable
      complement to RSD varieties. \n\nAlso notice the copper roofs of the domes,
      nave, and transepts. In the course of fifty-five years, they&#039;ve reach their
      metal&#039;s end-state of weathering\u2014the bluish-green patina characteristic
      of copper sulfate and copper carbonate compounds.\n\n&lt;b&gt;This site, and
      many others in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming
      book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53241541841/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;

      western side of Rio Grande Village Road, about 0.2 road mi (0.4 km) northeast
      of the big Tornillo Creek Bridge. This vantagepoint is a few tens of meters/yards
      northeast of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53152838457/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      Part 6 photo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nI arrived at this site none too soon.
      A few minutes later the shadow evident at bottom had obscured even the crest
      of this rise. As it was, though, the low-angle light of late afternoon beautifully
      highlighted the dike of igneous rock cutting through Upper Cretaceous Pen Formation
      shale and claystone. The Pen beds closest to the dike were cooked into somewhat
      harder form when the magma forced its way into them. This is a very localized
      version of what geologists call &lt;i&gt;contact metamorphism&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nAlso
      getting its last dose of direct sun is a scraggily cluster of what I suppose
      is Faxon Yucca (&lt;i&gt;Yucca faxoniana&lt;/i&gt;). This species is better
      known in Trans-Pecos Texas as Dagger\u2014a fitting tribute to its lethally
      pointed, rigid, and sword-shaped leaves.  \n\nAs you can see for yourself on
      Google Earth, in both aerial and street views, the dike actually runs straight
      as an arrow on both sides of the road. But, as noted in the previous description,
      I can find no source that identifies its exact petrologic composition. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      the shaft-grave walls in this famous burial complex.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nWhile the
      unmortared rubble blocks on view in this shot are probably too small to be considered
      &lt;i&gt;cyclopean&lt;/i&gt;\u2014the help of a mythical one-eyed giant wouldn&#039;t
      have been required to heft them\u2014they are just about as diverse in shape
      as they are monolithic in the type of stone they represent. \n\nThe fact that
      the larger chunks of rock are being held in place by so many wedgelike smaller
      ones makes me wonder whether this wall was largely rebuilt in the nineteenth
      century AD or later by archaeological excavators. I have trouble imagining all
      those tidy little bits surviving in their appointed nooks since the Late Bronze
      Age.\n\nHowever recent or ancient this particular masonry is, the material it&#039;s
      made of, the locally quarried Mycenae Limestone, has a history that stretches
      back more than 200 Ma. It was in the span from the Upper Triassic to the Middle
      Jurassic periods of the Mesozoic era that this sedimentary rock began as limey
      mud deposited on a carbonate platform in the Tethys Ocean. At that time, that
      great saltwater seaway stretched all the way from Spain to what is now Southeast
      Asia. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this series,

      at the church&#039;s eastern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nI&#039;m not sure what
      sort of repair or restoration work was underway during my visit, but I am sure
      that nothing would have tempted me to walk up that ramshackle timber ramp.  \n\nOne
      of the distinctive design features of Sts. Theodores is that has three triple-sided
      apses. I would love to think there was some doubling down on Trinitarian symbolism
      going on here, but I may just be playing too much into it.\n\nIn any event,
      this vantagepoint offers a great view both of the pitted &amp;quot;poros&amp;quot;
      ashlar\u2014probably either Piraeus Limestone or Megara Limestone, both of which
      are marly, highly fossiliferous, and Pliocene\u2014and the brick-and-stone cloisonn\xE9
      masonry so typical of Athenian Middle Byzantine style.\n\nIn this shot, the
      terra-cotta &lt;i&gt;solenes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;kalupter&lt;/i&gt; tiles
      look pretty mossy and patched in places with some whitish material (concrete?).
      Much more modern imagery on Google Earth Street View shows the roof in better
      shape overall. \n\nAlso note the striking brick-and-thick-mortar patterns adorning
      the upper reaches of the arched windows.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos

      height_l=\"683\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;A visual representation
      of the sublime mathematical formula\n\n&lt;b&gt;A + B = C &lt;/b&gt;\n\nwhere
      A = Chicago&#039;s Extremist Continental Climate, B = Unprotected Carrara Marble,
      and C = Big Trouble.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis is one section of the monument&#039;s
      inscribed plinth, which obviously has not benefited from the sculpture-enclosing
      glass case above it. (Do contrast this part of the memorial with that shown
      in the Part 11 photo.) \n\nThere is plenty of &lt;i&gt;sugaring&lt;/i&gt; (pitted,
      granular surfaces) evident. And while the large-lettered names of both the Franceses
      interred here are still legible, the legends below are much more badly deteriorated.\n\nLike
      its protolith limestone, marble is a rock made of calcite, otherwise known as
      calcium carbonate. Over time, this mineral reacts to and breaks down in even
      a weak acid. Purest rainwater, with a pH rating of 5.5 or a little less, qualifies
      for that category. And of course our modern day atmospheric pollutants, lessened
      but not completely removed in the US by the provisions of the Clean Air Act,
      lower the pH even more and hasten the corrosion process.     \n\nAlso visible
      is the inevitable result of using a cupriferous metal and marble in close proximity
      outdoors: copious copper-salts staining (specifically, forms of copper carbonate,
      copper sulfate, or both). On copper roofs or cast-bronze statues this bluish-green
      patina is a distinct ornamental asset. But when it&#039;s deposited by dripping
      rainwater onto chaste marble surfaces it creates a weepy, patchy, forlorn effect.
      \n\nAs far as the dark-gray to black blotches go, they may simply be soot. But
      I wish some microbiologist (with the requisite cemetery-management permission,
      of course) would take a tiny, noninvasive sample to see if this is in fact a
      microbial community. I&#039;d like to think it&#039;s a miniature ecosystem
      of  calciphilic cyanobacteria. But what do I know?\n\nFinally, I can&#039;t
      resist also commenting on the pebbles that have been placed by someone at bottom.
      I know that devotees of the waymarking cult engage in this ritualistic practice
      all over the place in cemeteries, tree hollows, etc. But I prefer to think that
      this particular offering is the work of some Windy City Druids or stone worshippers
      instead.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To learn much more about this site and 200 others in the
      Windy City, make it your top personal priority to get a copy of my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago
      in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;, described at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..&quot;

      This is the portion of the northern side of the eastern wing of the Barracks
      that&#039;s closest to the Tower. A small section of the latter is seen at far
      right.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis shot shows only a very small percentage of the approximately
      6 million Fort Sheridan Bricks to be found in this former military base. All
      were manufactrured nearby, from Pleistocene Wadsworth Formation till mined by
      the Lake Michigan bluff. The till&#039;s abnormally high calcium and magnesium
      content accounts for the brick&#039;s distinctive cream color. For a closer
      look, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52284996877/in/album-72177720302658037/&quot;&gt;Part
      8&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nAccording to some cads, bounders, and philistines, one of the
      chief drawbacks of cream brick is its susceptibility to becoming dingy due to
      soot accumulation (as can be seen here in places). However, true aesthetes of
      refined sensibilities and heightened soulfulness will instantly recognize that
      instead the soot adds an air of dignified maturity to it. \n\nSome of the Tower&#039;s
      Regional Silurian Dolostone base can be seen at right. What quarry supplied
      this stone may be known to the Fort Sheridan Historical Society, but that august
      group has not responded to my repeated inquiries. \n\n&lt;b&gt;And the other

      height_l=\"689\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Facing eastward
      and looking at a portion of San Sebasti\xE1n&#039;s facade (western elevation).&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIt&#039;s
      evident from more recent photos that the church&#039;s portal has been restored
      since this shot was taken. Here the archivolts look bare, but nowadays they&#039;re
      decorated with carved ornament that reminds me of embroidered lace.\n\nThe only
      even vaguely informative description I&#039;ve found for this site is &lt;a
      href=&quot;https://www.arteguias.com/monumentos/iglesia-san-sebastian-segovia.htm&quot;
      rel=&quot;noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;a Spanish-language webpage&lt;/a&gt;
      that speaks of yellow-weathering &lt;i&gt;piedra caliza&lt;/i&gt; (limestone)
      of the eastern elevation. All my other sources say that Segovia Sandstone, the
      Late Cretaceous architectural-workhorse quarried locally, was the main building
      material for this city&#039;s Romanesque churches. But is San Sebasti\xE1n the
      grand petrological exception?\n\nThe problem is that architectural historians
      are often abysmally sloppy or even overtly witless about building-material identification.
      They routinely think that the terms &amp;quot;limestone&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sandstone&amp;quot;
      can be used interchangeably, or even plugged in as synonyms for still other
      things. These folks should be marched straight to their nearest community college
      and enrolled in an Earth Science 101 course. \n\nHad I not come across that
      one annoying reference, I would have simply surmised that this venerable house
      of worship, like so many others in town, is indeed made of Segovia Sandstone
      with some Late Carboniferous Guadarrama Granite also present in the portal ashlar&#039;s
      lower courses. \n\nBut now I&#039;m plagued with doubt. The fact is that there
      are dolostone and limestone strata (Late Cretaceous; directly overlying the
      Segovia Sandstone) that also outcrop in and about town. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised
      if they&#039;d been used for construction purposes, as well.  But until better
      information comes to hand, the situation remains unresolved. So it goes, all
      too often, in architectural geology.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and

      height_l=\"768\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;On the boardwalk
      along the Cedar Point Tideland Trail. Here we&#039;re looking westward across
      the inlet at the town of Swansboro.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nA study in curving, yin-and-yang
      symmetry, in a place where  the Earth&#039;s spheres\u2014bio, hydro, litho,
      and atmo\u2014all knit together so beautifully. \n\nAnd this is the perfect
      spot to appreciate the two dominant herbaceous species that form huge colonies
      in the saline, organics-rich substrate of eastern North America&#039;s coastal
      wetlands. Both can be identified at some distance, thanks to their characteristic
      colors and habitats.\n\nThe first of these, usually found at the lower, routinely
      flooded level of the salt marsh, is the yellowish-green Smooth Cord Grass. A
      true Grass Family (Poaceae) member, it was originally classified as &lt;i&gt;Spartina
      alterniflora&lt;/i&gt;. But recently botanical taxonomists have changed the
      name to &lt;i&gt;Sporobolus alterniflorus&lt;/i&gt;. The nomenclatural switch
      may have been justified by some arcane genomic study or pedantic morphologic
      detail. Still, it&#039;s a slick and easy way for the revisers to get published
      in the professional literature. And that&#039;s what it&#039;s all about in
      the ivied halls of Careerist Science.\n\nThe other plant in question, which
      thrives on slightly higher ground, is Black Rush, still unassailably &lt;i&gt;Juncus
      roemerianus&lt;/i&gt;, I dearly hope. Its common name accurately describes it:
      at close range it is a deep blackish-green; farther away, almost solid black.\n\nIn
      the background are some of the tall, storm-damaged or storm-killed Loblolly
      Pines (&lt;i&gt;Pinus taeda&lt;/i&gt;) more fully discussed in this set&#039;s

      from Grand Avenue toward the building&#039;s southern elevation. \n\nThanks
      to Kevin Hansen, who in my discussion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53141585556/in/album-72177720310008578/&quot;&gt;the
      Wallace House&lt;/a&gt; mentioned this one, and so inspired me to post pictures
      of it, too.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nOriginally situated on a lakeshore plot now occupied
      by a large power plant, the Dodge House has been moved twice over the decades.
      In its present site it serves as Port Washington&#039;s Visitor Center. The
      modern main entrance is not the blue door at right, but another one under the
      add-on porch at left.\n\nA fetching little sweet pea of a house, this is my
      absolute favorite cobblestone structure in the Upper Midwest, though it does
      have some stiff competition. The surf-rounded rocks that so effectively adorn
      its exterior were painstakingly collected by Edward Dodge and his wife Elizabeth
      during their strolls along the Lake Michigan beach nearby. \n\nThis pair of
      do-it-yourself architects and stonemasons also benefited from the proximity
      of high-grade Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) quarried just north of town,
      in rural Knellsville, and approximately 6 mi (9.3 km) down the road in Grafton
      and Cedarburg, as well. This stone type is present in the quoins, lintels, and
      sills. But the similar RSD of the 1930s-era porch and (I think) the present
      foundation came from Lannon, Wisconsin instead. Close-ups to come will show
      just how reefal and fossiliferous the original rock really is.\n\nI&#039;ll
      talk more about the Dodges&#039; nifty horizontal-banding-by-rock type in future
      posts. But for now, notice the sky-blue, &amp;quot;Pebble House&amp;quot; sign
      above the upper window. There are indeed some very large pebbles that were used
      for the exterior, but at more than 2.5 in (6.4 cm) long, most are actually cobbles.
      All these represent a span of more than 2 Ga of geologic history. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      height_l=\"768\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;An intimate look
      at this building&#039;s eastern elevation. In this case, the artiste&#039;s
      south paw, which provides scale, is actually on the southern side of these cladding
      panels. Trivial as this is, I thought I&#039;d mention it.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nOne
      of the most fascinating things about this site is that the bulk of its exterior
      is covered with terra-cotta of extraordinary texture. For all I know, it may
      reproduce a classic Moorish or Spanish Colonial design element, but I personally
      have never seen anything like it before.\n\nIt appears that the modelers at
      the American works in McHenry County, Illinois, used some kind of raking tool
      on the clay prior to firing in the kiln. (The clay itself was taken from Pleistocene
      Lemont Formation till mined on the firm&#039;s own land.) But how this globby
      and granular, high-relief surface was produced in addition to the ridges and
      furrows, I&#039;m just not sure. Are the bumps part of the overlying glaze,
      perhaps? \n\nIn any case, the overall effect is both visually impressive and
      utterly inviting to compulsive tactile exploration. If you visit this place,
      you&#039;ll find yourself running your fingers up and down its outer walls.
      \ \n\nMaybe there&#039;s some ceramicist or modern-day terra-cotta producer
      out there who can explain to me how this offbeat style was achieved\u2014? \n\n&lt;b&gt;This
      site, and many others in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length
      in my forthcoming book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53241541841/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;

      on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53023106816/in/album-72177720308988249/&quot;&gt;eastern
      Kentucky&#039;s &amp;quot;Natural Bridge,&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; which really is
      a &lt;i&gt;natural arch&lt;/i&gt; that stands on a high ridge between two different
      stream valleys. However, the Bell Smith Springs equivalent described here can
      probably lay claim to being the genuine article\u2014a true &lt;i&gt;natural
      bridge&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nThis is because it sits within the confines of a single
      valley, Bay Creek&#039;s canyon. The bridge formed when water dripping down
      a cliffside joint (fracture) eventually eroded out a large opening in the Pounds
      Sandstone and left only the upper section of rock\u2014the bridge\u2014intact.
      Much of its current span can be seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/&quot;&gt;Part

      my hearty and deeply inspired tour participants is home to plenty of green algae
      and probably some blue-green cyanobacteria as well. And the maroon tint, which
      really becomes pronounced when the cliff is wet, signals the Pounds&#039;s abundance
      of hematite, an iron-oxide mineral. \n\nThe Pounds Sandstone is a member of
      the Caseyville Formation, and therefore is Lower Pennsylvanian in age (or Lower
      Upper Carboniferous, if you can wrap your mind around that). It was deposited
      by streams established in valleys incised into older Mississippian (Lower Carboniferous)
      limestone. \n\nSigns of the ancient stream flow are plentiful in the Bell Smith
      Springs canyon, and especially on the wall here. Look for strata with diagonal
      slant markings. These &lt;i&gt;crossbeds&lt;/i&gt; indicate that those streams
      of more than 300 Ma ago flowed from left to right.    \n\n&lt;b&gt;For more

      of the church&#039;s bell tower, on the northeastern corner of the building.\n\nTo
      my knowledge, the term &amp;quot;tafoniaceous&amp;quot; is entirely bogus and
      patently unnecessary. But apparently it did succeed in catching your attention.
      You might as well read the rest of the description, too.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAs noted
      in previous photo captions of this set, the Ordovician St. Peter Sandstone exterior
      has been subjected to two altering forces. One of these, the hypercaffeinated
      chiseling of manic stonemasons, is further discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53139808135/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      7&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nThe other, the more gradual process of physical and chemical
      weathering, has in places produced weirdly wonderful honeycomb textures geologists
      call &lt;i&gt;tafoni&lt;/i&gt;. Sandstone and other granular rocks are especially
      prone to developing this striking effect.\n\nWhile the ashlar blocks in the
      foreground have been considerably gouged, hollowed, and puckered, they still
      bear traces of the comb-chiseling that preceded nature&#039;s own work. And
      the meddling human hand has also been active more recently. Note the pinkish
      mortar (it almost looks like lithified chewing gum) that has been slathered
      on in one spot in an attempt to hold back the inevitable. \n\nPersonally, I
      think the tafoni should be allowed to remain and even develop further. It gives
      this beautifully earthy house of worship, one of my most favorite Badger State
      buildings, a haunting, nature&#039;s-cathedral sort of look.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      2&lt;/a&gt;, but now rotated around to face south-southwestward and toward the
      westernmost section of the  Palace&#039;s facade. &lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhat may seem
      like nothing more than a tumbledown wall is in fact an excellent lesson in how
      the Byzantines inherited and adapted masonry and construction techniques from
      their Imperial Roman predecessors.\n\nThis terminal section of the Blachernae
      Walls, like the Palace in the background, was built of two locally derived materials:
      ashlar of pale-colored Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone, and red brick.\n\nIf they
      had just been used by themselves, the squared-off blocks of Miocene-epoch carbonate
      rock would have been known, by the Latin-speaking Western Romans at least, as
      &lt;i&gt;opus quadratum&lt;/i&gt;. On the other hand, had the brick been the
      only element in the design, that would have been &lt;i&gt;opus testaceum&lt;/i&gt;,
      or, if it faced a core of concrete, it would be &lt;i&gt;opus latericium&lt;/i&gt;.
      \n\nNot willing to be outdone by the ancients, modern archaeologists and architectural
      historians have cooked up still more pertinent terminology. For example, they
      call the horizontal bands of brick &lt;i&gt;bonding courses&lt;/i&gt;. This
      seems to suggest that they somehow better strengthened the wall in general.\n\nSo
      far, I haven&#039;t come across any civil engineer&#039;s structural analysis
      of bonding courses, but I have seen one or two suggestions that the layers of
      brick were inserted to prevent cracks from spreading too far in a wall. \n\nThis
      makes a lot of sense. Constantinople&#039;s land walls were designed take a
      lot beating without collapsing from all sorts of siege weaponry wielded by would-be
      invaders\u2014from catapults and battering rams in Late Roman times to fifteenth-century
      Turkish siege cannon.\n\nAnd both the Romans and the Byzantines, who spent an
      inordinate amount of their history attacking and defending things, probably
      learned from direct experience that stone-plus-brick construction produced a
      synergistic effect that kept their walls standing longer, even when they were
      being pummeled by formidable attackers.  \n\nOf course, there came a time in
      AD 1453 When Ottoman gunnery and the sheer weight of numbers negated the long
      legacy of Roman engineering. But up to that point the land walls had generally
      did a very good job over the centuries. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos

      at the turret and the adjoining section of the western elevation. I couldn&#039;t
      resist including the bare tree branches at left. Their peglike short stems identify
      them as that famous &amp;quot;living fossil,&amp;quot; the Ginkgo (&lt;/i&gt;Ginkgo
      biloba&lt;i&gt;).&lt;/i&gt; \n\nIn this final view of St. Paul&#039;s, it&#039;s
      time to take one last look at its Chequamegon Sandstone, and to also note another
      stone type that serves as the shingles of the turret&#039;s conical roof.  \n\nThe
      rock-faced, random-coursed Chequamegon ashlar has collected some soot in its
      time, but it still gives more than a hint of its brick-red base color. A product
      of Basswood Island in  northernmost Wisconsin&#039;s Apostles archipelago, this
      ruddy clastic sedimentary rock was deposited atop the mostly mafic, late-Mesoproterozoic
      lava flows of the Midcontinent Rift. Its own age is much more poorly constrained,
      and has been hypothesized to be everything from latest Mesoproterozoic to early
      Cambrian. This is the lot of a stone that lacks fossils and other datable clues.
      \n\nThe roofing stone, in contrast, almost certainly belongs to the Bushkill
      Slate. While I have yet to find written evidence for this, the tiles&#039; diagonal
      black-and-white striping is usually resoundingly diagnostic of that variety.
      \n\nThe Ordovician-period Bushkill is a foliated metamorphic rock. It was derived
      from a marine-shale protolith of a &lt;i&gt;flysch&lt;/i&gt;  deposit that collected
      in a now long-vanished foreland basin situated between Laurentia (ancestral
      North America) and a volcanic-island arc. It&#039;s better known in the roofing
      trade as &amp;quot;Chapman Slate&amp;quot;\u2014a reference to the town in eastern
      Pennsylvania where it was quarried. \n\n&lt;b&gt;This site, and many others
      in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming book

      height_l=\"683\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt; Taken along the
      western side of Rio Grande Village Road, about 0.2 road mi (0.4 km) northeast
      of the big Tornillo Creek Bridge.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nThis weird, crest-topped feature
      is a mound approximately 15 ft (4.6 m) high. It&#039;s mostly made of Upper
      Cretaceous Pen Formation claystone or shale, but it has a &lt;i&gt;dike&lt;/i&gt;
      of  igneous rock, visible at top, transecting it. \n\nA dike is a more-or-less
      vertically oriented, sheet-like structure formed when magma finds its way into
      a joint or other fracture in a preexisting body of rock, and then cools and
      solidifies. Often harder than the stone around it, the dike resists erosion
      more effectively when finally exposed at the surface, and so becomes a strange
      landform resembling a spine, a wall, or, in this case, a Mohawk haircut. \n\nWhen
      I first drove by this spot, I certainly knew what I was looking at. Big Bend
      National Park has a lot of dikes of different lithologies on view, at least
      if you know where to look for them. But in my experience none of the others
      are quite as close to a major roadway as this one. \n\nSo, after I&#039;d uttered
      the obligatory cry of astonishment and careened over onto the shoulder, I spent
      about fifteen minutes  wandering around it and photographing it as the late-afternoon
      shadows lengthened. What I did not do, however, was record the exact rock type
      the dike was made of. And now, two decades later, I simply can&#039;t remember.
      In this shot that slim mini-ridge running atop the Pen hump certainly looks
      like diabase or basalt\u2014and for that reason it probably isn&#039;t either.\n\nOf
      course, I&#039;ve subsequently pored through every available source on Big Bend
      geology I have or can find online. A couple of these actually mention the dike,
      but neither identifies it by rock name, or even states whether it&#039;s mafic
      or felsic. Typical. Just typical. It&#039;s hard to get good help.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      and looking at the church&#039;s western elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis Middle
      Byzantine gem, here splashed with low-angle winter light, was in a state of
      reconstruction when I tracked it down in its secluded lair. Note how far below
      the modern Athenian street grade it stands. Unwary pedestrians and cars are
      kept from falling into its well by a curb and, at the time I was there, by a
      fence as well.\n\nChronologically speaking, Sts. Theodores apparently sits in
      between the earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53128047076/in/album-72177720303792872/&quot;&gt;Holy
      Apostles Church&lt;/a&gt; in the Agora and the later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52477735805/in/album-72177720303792872/&quot;&gt;Daphni
      Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. And, like both of them, it features cloisonn\xE9 construction
      with blocks of ashlar\u2014presumably &lt;i&gt;poros&lt;/i&gt; stone\u2014separated
      by thin, waferlike bricks. \n\nWhere the poros came from remains a mystery to
      me. Is it the Pliocene Megara Limestone or the Pliocene Piraeus Limestone? Or
      was it brought in from the Isle of Aegina?\n\nAnd once again there are the alternating
      half-tubular (&lt;i&gt;kalupter&lt;/i&gt;) and flat (&lt;i&gt;solenes&lt;/i&gt;)
      terra-cotta roofing tiles, presumably manufactured from Attica&#039;s famous
      pottery clays.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this

      height_l=\"1024\" width_l=\"683\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Facing the head
      of the monument&#039;s upper portion. To make sense of exactly what you&#039;re
      looking at, it&#039;s best to refer to the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53128208018/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part
      10 photo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; \n\nThis is the first of two shots illustrating
      the relative weathering rates of &amp;quot;Statuario&amp;quot;-grade Carrara
      Marble for the upper, enclosed sculpted figures and the lower, unprotected plinth.
      Note that the glass of the case in front of the adult female&#039;s forearm
      reflects some nearby tree branches.\n\nIt&#039;s quite evident that the Carrara
      of the encased sculpture itself still holds all or most of its original detail,
      even after 167 years (at time of writing). The only real sign of possible marble
      deterioration is at lower left, on the bed under the lower cushion, where the
      sculptor inscribed his own particulars. While C. B. IVES, ROMA is still clearly
      legible, the 1856 that follows is much fainter now.\n\nInterestingly, a considerable
      amount of tan dust or other particulate matter has built up on the upper surfaces
      of the pillows and figures. And there&#039;s even a resident spider or the remains
      thereof visible, if you&#039;re willing to look hard enough. So the copper-
      or bronze-framed case is by no means airtight. What it has done, however, is
      to deflect the vast majority of the rain and snow away from the interior. \n\nThe
      plinth beneath is another story. The rim of the stone just below the metal case
      has experienced considerable &amp;quot;sugaring,&amp;quot; and has been corroded
      by acidic rainwater into a coarsely granular texture. There&#039;s also some
      darkening due to soot buildup or microbial activity, as well as blue-green staining.
      This is the inevitable result of water containing copper-salts weathering products
      dripping down from the case above. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To learn much more about this
      site and 200 others in the Windy City, make it your top personal priority to
      get a copy of my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;, described

      height_l=\"1024\" width_l=\"757\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt; Facing south-southwestward
      and looking at this huge complex&#039;s central section.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe lower
      portion of the imposing Tower is composed of some variety of Regional Silurian
      Dolostone (RSD), which architectural historians and suppliers invariably call
      &amp;quot;limestone.&amp;quot; I could probably determine which specific RSD
      type it is, were the Fort Sheridan Historical Society ever obliging enough to
      respond to my various inquiries. \n\nIt would be entirely plausible to suppose
      that the handsome pale-yellow brick that makes up the rest of this massive structure
      is Milwaukee&#039;s famed Cream City brand. After all, the brickworks of that
      great production center just 55 mi (90 km) up the coast fulfilled a number of
      orders for federal-building construction in the Great Lakes region\u2014especially
      lighthouses.\n\nHowever, when the United States Army moved into this site, it
      made use instead of a longstanding pit and brickmaking facility just to the
      southeast of here, in a Lake-Michigan-bluffside settlement then known as St.
      Johns. There the silty Pleistocene glacial till of the Wadsworth Formation had
      been dumped by the Wisconsin ice sheet some 14.6 ka ago. \n\nThis material shares
      an unusual geochemical trait with Cream City clays: it too is unusually rich
      in calcium and magnesium. When fired at high temperatures in the kiln, these
      two elements mask the normal red tones of the iron oxides also present, and
      produce off-white, yellow, and salmon tints instead.\n\nIn fact, there were
      a plenitude of other northeastern-illinois and southeastern-Wisconsin communities
      blanketed in the Wadsworth Formation and similar dolostone-derived sediments
      that formerly manufactured their own cream bricks as well.  I&#039;ll be posting
      photos of some of these, I hope, in the future.\n\nFor a good close-up of the
      Fort Sheridan Brick, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52284996877/in/album-72177720302658037/&quot;&gt;Part

      18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis is a good example of the state of the carved
      detail in the  Segovia Sandstone used here, at least as of 1978.\n\nThe darker
      deposits on some of the rock surfaces might be atmospheric pollutants. Then
      again, they could be microbial communities. They do not seem to have the texture
      of crustose or foliose lichens, but they could be cyanobacteria or algae thriving
      on their own without a fungal symbiont. \n\nAs my informal name for it suggests,
      the Segovia Sandstone was quarried locally. It dates to the Late Cretaceous
      period and was deposited in a near-shore, epeiric-sea environment after the
      breakup of Pangaea. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in

      lower portion of the hall&#039;s northern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIt&#039;s
      not all that often that I get to talk about building stone as its own ecosystem.
      But here the Silurian-age Lemont-Joliet Dolostone serves as a home for what
      I gather is a community of calciphilic green algae (Phylum Chlorophyta). Note
      that it sports a faint olive tint, even when dry and not actively photosynthesizing.
      \n\nCyanobacteria are also frequent colonizers of stone surfaces, but they often
      have a dark bluish-green or even blackish cast.  I&#039;m not ruling out their
      presence here, though. The outer surfaces of a single building can be an amazingly
      diverse menagerie of microorganisms. It&#039;s a reminder that though we human
      beings often arrogantly think we&#039;re the only living creatures that matter,
      there is in fact a multitude of other species creeping, crawling, and growing
      on, around, and in us.  \n\nThe dolostone itself is shown in its two most characteristic
      finishes: &lt;i&gt;rock-faced&lt;/i&gt;, in the courses of big ashlar blocks;
      and roughly &lt;i&gt;dressed-faced&lt;/i&gt;, in the sills, lintils, and tilted
      stringcourse I assume is intended as a &lt;i&gt;water table&lt;/i&gt; that deflects
      dripping precipitation outward from the structure&#039;s base and foundation.
      (Geologists and hydrologists use the same term for something quite different\u2014the
      boundary between groundwater in the zone of saturation and the dry zone of aeration
      above it.)\n\nOne common behavioral trait of the Lemont-Joliet Dolostone is
      evident here, as well. If you look closely at the water table, you&#039;ll see
      that it&#039;s undergoing &lt;i&gt;exfoliation&lt;/i&gt;: it&#039;s gradually
      shedding thin sheets of weathered rock. Indeed, small bits of spalled-off stone
      are visible on the ground. At this rate, the exterior may only survive a few
      more millennia. We should all be so lucky.\n\n&lt;b&gt;The other photos and

      and looking at the house&#039;s facade (eastern elevation) as well as its northern
      side.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe nineteenth-century cobblestone houses of northern Illinois
      and southern Wisconsin are a joy to discover and explore, both architecturally
      and geologically. \n\nThere are a number of mostly unreliable and spurious ways
      to distinguish cobblestone buildings from their fieldstone equivalents. The
      most obvious of these is that the former usually are clad in smaller, surf-
      or stream-rounded rocks.\n\nBut another way to tell the difference in styles
      is to examine the amount of mortar that remains exposed after the masons&#039;
      job is done. In cobblestone exteriors\u2014at least in those of my experience\u2014the
      lime-rich matrix is just about as abundant and ornamentally important as the
      rocks inserted in it.\n\nAs is explained more fully in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52289685402/in/album-72177720310008578/&quot;&gt;Part
      12&lt;/a&gt;, the cobbles on view here \u2014everything from Archean Canadian-Shield
      granitoids and Mesoproterozoic flood basalts to Regional Silurian Dolostone\u2014were
      laboriously carted all the way from the Lake Michigan shore. The meticulous
      artfulness with which they were set into the mortar becomes more and more apparent
      the longer you scrutinize their patterns. \n\nNote, for example, how somewhat
      larger stones were used at the base, and in the hourglass (?) figure set above
      and between the lintels of the upper windows.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos

      building&#039;s southeastern corner.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe style employed here has
      been variously described as Mediterranean Revival, Moorish Revival, and Spanish
      Colonial Revival. It features flamboyant motifs also found on American movie
      palaces of the Roaring Twenties.\n\nThis two-storied confection is one of the
      Cream City&#039;s best examples of the artistry and craftsmanship of the American
      Terra Cotta Company. That firm, which was located in what is now part of the
      suburban sprawlopolis of Crystal Lake, Illinois, derived its base material from
      the clays of the Pleistocene till that blanket the American property. Illinois
      geologists classify this accumulation of poorly sorted, glacially deposited
      sediments as the Lemont Formation. \n\n&lt;b&gt;This site, and many others in
      Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming book

      vertiginous take on the Victorian Gothic style that was so much in vogue in
      the years following the American Civil War. \n\nThe exterior&#039;s Lemont-Joliet
      Dolostone, taken from the same 425-Ma-old bedrock that underlies Evanston, was
      quarried about 30 mi (48 km) to the southwest of here, in the Lower Des Plaines
      River Valley. \n\nWhile its popularity gradually waned in the years following
      Chicago&#039;s 1871 Great Fire, the Lemont-Joliet can still be seen adorning
      countless older structures along the Lake Michigan littoral of Illinois and
      Wisconsin. Together with the other varieties of Regional Silurian Dolostone,
      it is the one rock type most emblematic of the built environment of Chicago,
      Milwaukee, and their constellations of suburbs and satellite cities.\n\n&lt;b&gt;The

      part of the church&#039;s southern face.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIt&#039;s pretty obvious
      that the stonemasons who built this house of worship simply could not resist
      chiseling like crazy into the relatively soft St. Peter Sandstone ashlar. They
      did so with a manic intentness other people exhibit in popping sheets of bubble-wrap.\n\nIn
      this stretch of exterior wall, it seems as though the merry chiselers were trying
      to produce something akin to &lt;i&gt;vermiculation&lt;/i&gt;, a decorative
      pattern of extended curving lines that resembles worm trails. But within the
      long and narrow grooves there are also myriads of individual chisel-head chinks
      that remind me of the network of tiny-chambered tubes made by ancient tabulate
      corals. Maybe their makers were channeling some of their region&#039;s abundant
      Paleozoic fossil record. \n\nIn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53119386893/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;this
      set&#039;s Part 6&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that some of the church&#039;s Ordovician-age
      St. Pete has actually developed &lt;i&gt;tafoni&lt;/i&gt; weathering surfaces
      that resemble honeycomb. A really dramatic example of that will be posted soon.
      But even here, in the right-hand block of the course second from bottom, you
      can see some tafoni developing.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      1 of this set&lt;/a&gt;, but now facing northward and away from the Palace.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe
      Blachernae Walls were built in different sections after the fifth-century AD
      construction of the Theodosian Walls. The latter start just to the south of
      here and extend down to the Sea of Marmara, while their shorter equivalent seen
      here reaches north to the Golden Horn. \n\nThe Blachernae Walls have various
      portions named for the Eastern Roman rulers who built them, but their collective
      moniker comes from that of the great imperial residence that once stood in this
      vicinity. This segment of the ramparts shares the same general elements of Middle
      to Late Byzantine masonry construction as the still-extant Palace of the Porphyrogenitus.
      \n\nOnce again, there&#039;s an alternation of red brick, presumably manufactured
      from clays mined fairly locally, and the light-gray Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone.
      This fossiliferous, Miocene-epoch carbonate sedimentary rock was quarried a
      few miles away, outside the city&#039;s defensive fortifications.\n\nTo compare
      how this stretch of wall has been partially restored in the past five decades,
      take a look at it on Google Earth. \n\n&lt;b&gt;And to see the other photos

      of the doorway at the church&#039;s southwestern corner, and at the base of
      the bell tower.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis is an even closer look at Lake Superior Brownstone,
      and specifically  the Chequamegon Sandstone quarried on Basswood Island in the
      Apostles archipelago of northernmost Wisconsin.  \n\nWhile many people think
      geology is the study of rocks and minerals and nothing else, it is in fact a
      field that encompasses a host of interrelated subjects. For example, it&#039;s
      also a science of processes: of how things change over time.\n\nHere, there&#039;s
      not only an intrinsically interesting stone type to scrutinize; there is also
      intruiging evidence of what, in one place at least, has happened to it. I refer
      to the large, polygonal ashlar block to the left of the polished pink-granitoid
      pillars. Big sections of it have spalled away to reveal the true, soot-free
      color of the Chequamegon. \n\nBut also notice the wrinkled-skin texture of the
      original, darker, dressed-face surface that still survives. This crustlike layer
      is characteristic of &lt;i&gt;case hardening&lt;/i&gt;, a process commonly encountered
      in the weathering of sandstones and such granular limestones as Indiana&#039;s
      Salem (&amp;quot;Bedford Stone&amp;quot;).\n\nCase hardening occurs in porous
      rock when, over time, water with dissolved salts migrates through its pores
      and eventually reaches an exposed face. There the salts precipitate out and
      form a hard rind that does indeed look like a sort of puckered or bumpy epidermis.
      And sometimes the rind breaks and falls away, especially on vertical surfaces.\n\nOften
      the interior of a case-hardened stone is much softer and crumblier, but here
      the newly exposed rock still seems quite competent.   \n\n&lt;b&gt;This site,
      and many others in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in
      my forthcoming book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53241541841/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;

      from a point along the Persimmon Gap Road about 6.0 road mi (9.7 km) south of
      the Persimmon Gap Visitor Center. From this spot the 1987 rockslide scar discussed

      4&lt;/a&gt; is still visible, but it&#039;s out of this frame to the left. &lt;/i&gt;
      \ \n\nIn this stretch the road is built on Pleistocene to Holocene alluvial-fan
      deposits that are blanketed with &lt;i&gt;desert pavement&lt;/i&gt;, the surficial
      layer of pebbles and cobbles that often mantles Aridisol soil profiles of the
      American Southwest.\n\nOccupying center stage in this shot is that most distinctive
      member of Big Bend&#039;s flora, the Ocotillo or Coach-whip Plant (&lt;i&gt;Fouquieria
      splendens&lt;/i&gt;). If you look closely, you can see that its apical inflorescences
      are beginning to blush red, though their stunningly scarlet flowers, so irresistible
      to local hummingbirds and Yanqui turistas, have not yet popped open. Alas, I
      arrived a day or two early.\n\nMuch more numerous are the lower, greener Creosote
      Bushes (&lt;i&gt;Larrea tridentata&lt;/i&gt;). They seem to extend back all
      the way to the low Boquillas Formation flatirons that front the Santiago Mountains.\n\nAlso
      prominently featured on the bill are big clumps of &lt;i&gt;Opuntia&lt;/i&gt;
      Prickly Pear Cactus. While the pure-green type would require closer scrutiny
      to pin down to the species level, I&#039;d guess that the lower-growing, rose-tinted
      one is Purple Prickly Pear (&lt;i&gt;O. macrocentra&lt;/i&gt;). At this range
      it&#039;s impossible to be sure, but you can take a closer look at a better-identified
      specimen, as well as Creosote Bush and desert pavement, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52479200471/in/album-72177720302395234/&quot;&gt;this

      side of the grave circle, and looking northward, more or less.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nHaving
      recently posted some pics of much more recent gravesites in Chicago, Milwaukee,
      and other spots in the American Midwest, I can&#039;t help reflecting on how
      human preferences for what constitutes a proper burial have changed over the
      centuries. \n\nHere, Mycenae&#039;s Bronze Age notables were interred much more
      geologically and less botanically: in a communal fortresslike structure, and
      in deep, rock-ribbed shafts\u2014rather than in individual shallow plots scattered
      over a verdant, parklike landscape. \n\nIn this shot it&#039;s easier to distinguish
      between the coarse-textured Myceneae Conglomerate (Pliocene to Pleistocene)
      of the upright slabs and the Mycenae Limestone (Triassic to Jurassic) of the
      inner, vertical surfaces. The latter is used in a strange sort of way, with
      random, cyclopean-style masonry transitioning here and there into regularly
      coursed ashlar. I&#039;m not sure how much of this is undisturbed original stonework
      and how much has been  reconstructed, creatively or scrupulously, by archaeological
      excavators.  \n\nWhat is certain, though, is the presence of that classic derivative
      of limestone bedrock, &lt;i&gt;terra rossa&lt;/i&gt; soil. I discuss it more
      fully in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52810491641/in/album-72177720303812060/&quot;&gt;Part

      famous North-Side burial ground, Graceland Cemetery, Rosehill is built atop
      a ridge that formed as a sand spit during a highstand of one of modern Lake
      Michigan&#039;s postglacial predecessors. And it too is a geological wonderland
      featuring a wide array of ornamental stones from my different locales.\n\nThis
      elaborate and evocative mass of carved Carrara Marble features two reclining
      figures\u2014mother Frances and her young daughter of the same name, who died
      only two months after her namesake. Originally installed in what is now the
      city&#039;s waterfront Lincoln Park, the monument was relocated here with the
      remains in 1861.\n\nThe sculpted ensemble, a masterpiece of melodramatic Victorian
      grief, is the work of American Chauncey B. Ives, then living in Rome, Italy.
      When the monument was transfered to Rosehill, husband Horatio O. Stone made
      sure its upper portion was enclosed in a glass case\u2014a wise practice also
      followed elsewhere in this graveyard for other marble memorials. \n\nLong considered
      one of the world&#039;s premium building and sculptural stones, the Carrara
      is a fine-grained calcitic marble whose protolith was a limestone of Upper Triassic
      to Lower Jurassic age. It was metamophosed into its present, sugary-textured
      form in the Oligocene, about 27 Ma ago, when it was buried under the Tuscan
      Nappe. It has since been exposed at the surface in the Apuan Alps north of Pisa,
      in a tectonic window extensively exploited by Italian quarriers ever since Etruscan
      times.\n\nWhile the Carrara often survives well in outdoor environments in its
      native Mediterranean climate, it frequently deteriorates badly in Temperate,
      continental-interior regimes, where it&#039;s  exposed to greater precipitation
      and to wilder temperature extremes. The most infamous example of Carrara misuse
      in the Windy City was the late-twentieth-century failure of the original cladding
      of the Amoco Building (now Aon Center).\n\nFrom a geological standpoint, the
      Pearce Monument is a fantastic place to show the difference in weathering rates
      between the still mostly pristine enclosed portion and the unprotected and much
      more affected base. As following detail shots will show . . .\n\n&lt;b&gt;To
      learn much more about this site and 200 others in the Windy City, make it your
      top personal priority to get a copy of my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago in Stone and
      Clay&lt;/i&gt;, described at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..&quot;

      Philadelphia Facing Brick in all its glory. Its distinctive color reflects both
      its abundance of iron compounds and the lack of significant amounts of calcium
      and magnesium that would mask the characteristic iron-oxide tint seen here.\n\nAs
      noted in this set&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52372446051/in/album-72177720302658037/&quot;&gt;Part
      4&lt;/a&gt;, this famous Philly product, which is the very definition of brick-red,
      came from claypits dug into the Quaternary-period Trenton Gravel formation.
      I will have much more to say about its origins, and about this building, in
      my upcoming book &lt;i&gt;Milwaukee in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;, due to be released
      in early 2024.\n\nForming the trim and plinth is an unfortunately unrecorded
      type of Lake Superior Brownstone\u2014almost certainly either Wisconsin&#039;s
      own Chequamegon Sandstone or Upper Michigan&#039;s Jacobsville Sandstone. You
      can learn a lot more about both these LSB types by checking out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720306314298&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brownstone
      Chronicles&lt;/i&gt; album&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nAlso of note, and also of geologic
      origin, is the snazzy iron grillwork of the basement windows. I&#039;m not sure
      whether it&#039;s wrought or cast. Regardless, its Fe content was undoubtedly
      obtained from some rock deposit rich in iron ore.  \n\n&lt;b&gt;This site, and
      many others in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming
      book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53241541841/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;

      side of the church&#039;s western elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis is a more straightforward
      look at the end section of the same porch featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53101255920/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      17&lt;/a&gt;. Here the differences in color and textures between what I very
      plausibly infer, albeit without direct evidence, to be the pinkish-gray Guadarrama
      Granite and the better documented, warm-brown Segovia Sandstone are especially
      apparent. As noted elsewhere in this series, the first of these locally produced
      rock types dates back to the Late Carboniferous phase of the Variscan Orogeny,
      whereas the second is Late Cretaceous in age.\n\nOne interesting feature of
      the putative Guadarrama is the presence of large darker spots on the surface
      of the ashlar blocks. These may simply be some sort of staining, but they remind
      me powerfully of the kind of &amp;quot;knots&amp;quot; seen on certain granites
      quarried for building stone in such US states as Maine and Minnesota. \n\nKnots
      are large clusters of ferromagnesian-mineral crystals that congregate in a pluton&#039;s
      magma prior to solidification. Most frequently they&#039;re composed of hornblende,
      biotite mica, or both together. Stone cutters traditionally consider them unsightly,
      but nevertheless they can be found in substantial numbers on such architecturally
      notable American edifices as Milwaukee&#039;s Mitchell and Mackie Buildings,
      and Chicago&#039;s Auditorium Building. \n\nA quick check of modern imagery
      of this side of San Mart\xEDn on Google Earth Street View confirms that its
      spots are still there. So knots they probably are.  \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the

      in an unsettling sort of way. There I was,  a full six years later, back in
      front of the same building cited in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52422598937/in/album-72177720306314298/&quot;&gt;Part

      15&lt;/a&gt;, photographing it at even closer range than before. Fortunately
      for me, the Houghton County dogcatcher was off on another call, and no large
      nets were available elsewhere. But eventually I wandered off the site on my
      own, and civic calm was restored.&lt;/i&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;First, the description:&lt;/b&gt;\n\nAn
      intimate look at the &amp;quot;Portage Red&amp;quot; brand of Upper Michigan&#039;s
      Jacobsville Sandstone. Due to the spotty look imparted by its pale reduction
      zones, this variegated grade of an otherwise very popular variety was considered
      unsuitable for finer architectural settings in such Great Lakes cities as Milwaukee
      and Chicago. But it was widely employed in local structures of a more ultilitarian
      type. For more on the geology of the Jacobsville, click the Part 14 link above.
      \n\n&lt;b&gt;Next, the reminiscence:&lt;/b&gt;\n\nIn the past quarter-century,
      I have presented over 350 public talks and keynotes on natural-history topics
      for various libraries, nature centers, universities, clubs, professional societies,
      and corporate clients. At one of these, a very nice attendee who was a commercial
      artist suggested I post as many of my geology images online as I possibly could.
      She told me that she found the patterns displayed in them both fascinating and
      inspiring to her own creativity.\n\nI was really impressed with that, and not
      long thereafter I started my Flickr postings. I hope that artist has come across
      my rock pics since. I now realize that most other Flickr posters prefer treacly
      cat portraits, unidentified butterflies on unidentified flowers, and digitally
      enhanced landscapes to close-ups of stone. Still, I&#039;ve always enjoyed the
      company of a few fellow travelers who can see both the science and natural artistry
      of stone. And that, as it so happens, is all that it takes.\n\n&lt;b&gt; Finally,

      bell tower&#039;s base, let&#039;s scan the projecting fieldstone blocks and
      cite their general types, source locales, and ages. See how many you can identify,
      despite the covering of soot in places:\n\n- Dark-brown to black basalt and
      probably also gabbro; Michigan&#039;s Keweenaw Peninsula; Late Mesoproterozoic.\n\n-
      Greenstone (metabasalt); probably Michigan&#039;s Upper Peninsula; probably
      Neoarchean.\n\n- Porphyritic, brick-red rhyolite; probably Canadian Shield (Ontario?);
      Proterozoic or Archean.\n\n- Both red and gray granitoids; northern Wisconsin,
      Upper Michigan, or Ontario; Proterozoic to Archean.\n\n- Heavily weathered schist;
      northern Wisconsin, Upper Michigan, or Ontario; Proterozoic to Archean.\n\n-
      Pale-gray to buff dolostone, sometimes with large chert nodules; eastern Wisconsin
      or Michigan&#039;s Upper Peninsula; Silurian or possibly Devonian.\n\nAnd there
      are probably others.\n\nIn earlier parts of this set I mentioned that the dressed-face
      trim is mostly Lemont-Joliet Dolostone of Silurian age. But in this case it
      appears to be concrete from the 1930 church renovation and addition that was
      tinted to match the original dolostone.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this site, see

      height_l=\"1024\" width_l=\"770\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Looking northeastward
      across North Lincoln Avenue. Apropos of that, note the stylish expression of
      Windy City Chic embodied in the Dayglo-yellow Abe-Lincoln-motif parking meter.
      Them city folks sure is elegant.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nA common sight in books on Chicago
      architecture, this small storefront facade was the last completed commission
      of the man Frank Lloyd Wright called his &lt;i&gt;lieber Meister&lt;/i&gt;\u2014Louis
      Sullivan. Another former employee of the latter, William C. Presto, was the
      building&#039;s overall designer.\n\nThe profusion of greenish-gray terra-cotta
      ornament may seem a trifle overdone, but who cares; when Sullivan is off on
      a riff of the imagination, just let him go and go and go. And that is especially
      true for his productions in fired clay created in his dark and lonely final
      years, when clients other than this one were mostly limited to shoebox banks
      in such small Midwestern towns as Sidney, Ohio; Columbus, Wisconsin; and Owatonna,
      Minnesota.\n\nThe botanical inspiration of much of the Master&#039;s detail
      reveals itself in this set&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52306905598/in/album-72177720302670488/&quot;&gt;Part
      6&lt;/a&gt;. As noted in the description there, this glazed terra-cotta was
      crafted by some of the best modelers of their day, in the American works in
      northeastern Illinois&#039; McHenry County. The base material was often taken
      from Pleistocene Lemont Formation glacial till mined on the American property.

      section of the church&#039;s southern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIn general, sandstones
      are too soft and granular to take a polish, so masons who work with this clastic
      sedimentary rock type often resort to other decorative techniques instead.\n\nAs
      a following photo will also show, a number of different tooled finishes were
      used on the St. Peter Sandstone ashlar. Here it seems to be a kind of coarse
      comb chiseling. \n\nThe St. Peter, Middle Ordovician in age, was deposited approximately
      460 Ma ago in the shallow, nearshore water of an epeiric sea that covered what
      is now the American Midwest. Its grains are pure quartz whose rounded forms
      and frosted surfaces suggest that they&#039;d first been blown about on land\u2014on
      beachfront dunes, perhaps?  \n\nWhile the St. Pete quarried for building stone
      in southwestern Wisconsin is more solidly cemented than it often is elsewhere,
      it&#039;s not all that well indurated even here. This is quite evident on this
      section of the church, where it&#039;s showing signs of structural cracking
      and spalling that&#039;s had to be patched up with some extra mortar. I suspect
      there&#039;s some significant case hardening going on.\n\nOn the positive side,
      both the St. Pete&#039;s gritty texture and its rich weathering palette of earth-toned
      iron-oxide minerals give this house of worship a real &amp;quot;nature&#039;s
      cathedral&amp;quot; look. This will be especially apparent when I show you some
      of its honeycombed tafoni surfaces. Stay tuned.   \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other

      Ruins of the southernmost section of the Walls of Blachernae stand at right;
      the northermost portion of the Theodosian Walls starts behind the palace.&lt;/i&gt;
      \n\nThis old slide transfer is in itself something of a historical document,
      in that it shows this Late Byzantine imperial palace as it looked in its darkest
      (?) days as a roofless shell of masonry, before its early-twenty-first-century
      restoration as a museum.  \n\nIf only this remarkable structure, set smack dab
      against the city&#039;s western defensive fortifications, could talk. Apparently
      it was built for Constantine, a born-in-the-purple (&lt;i&gt;Porphyrogenitus&lt;/i&gt;)
      son of emperor Michael VIII. \n\nWhile Constantine himself never achieved full
      imperial rank, his father is well known to Byzantine-history buffs and coin
      collectors as the founder of Constantinople&#039;s final Christian dynasty,
      the Paleologans. Embattled as they were by the ever-encroaching Turks, the predatory
      Genoese and Venetians, and their own inter- and extra-dynastic intrigues, the
      Paleologans presided over a remarkable final flowering of Eastern Roman architecture
      and art. As swan songs go, it was one of the finest.  \n\nBut after the Ottoman
      capture of the city, the badly-damaged ex-palace served as practically everything
      imaginable, including a menagerie for the reigning sultan, a brothel, a pottery
      factory, and a sort of mini-ghetto for poor Jewish families. By the time I visited
      it in late 1976, its primary function seemed to be as an exercise space for
      free-range chickens that emanated from a nearby hovel.\n\nBut even in the its
      forlorn state depicted here, the palace is an utter marvel of of the masons&#039;
      art. I put &amp;quot;masons&#039;&amp;quot; in the plural possessive because
      it&#039;s a wonder of both brick and stone work. Has any other culture alternated
      and integrated one building material with another more masterfully?  \n\nI regret
      I haven&#039;t found any source that cites the location of the claypits that
      produced the facade&#039;s red-brick component. But one account does suggest
      that the light-tinted ashlar is, as I myself had recalled, the Miocene-epoch
      Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone. This ubiquitous building material, used so frequently
      in the great architectural projects of emperors and sultans alike, was quarried
      not all that far away, on the other side of the Theodosian Walls. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      just north of the Schaible Science Center.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nWhile this species
      has been a fairly popular street-tree selection in the US since the 1980s, the
      handsome specimen shown here isn&#039;t exactly a curbside planting. Nor should
      it be, given its full lower branching. I include it in this set as a comparison
      to the closely related Bald Cypress  (&lt;i&gt;Taxodium distichum&lt;/i&gt;)
      street tree featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53094181823/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      20&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nLike the much more famous Ginkgo (&lt;i&gt;Ginkgo biloba&lt;/i&gt;),
      the Dawn Redwood is a &amp;quot;living fossil&amp;quot;\u2014an organism with
      a very long pedigree in the paleontological record. Mesozoic-era fossils of
      its genus were first identified in 1941, and for a short time it was considered
      extinct. Ironically, just a few years later living trees were discovered in
      a remote portion of China, and they were ultimately identified as a small, surviving
      but endangered population of &lt;i&gt;Metasequoia&lt;/i&gt;. \n\nLike the Bald
      Cypress, the Dawn Redwood is a conifer that has the fairly unusual trait of
      being &lt;i&gt;deciduous&lt;/i&gt;\u2014it drops its lacy, pinnately arranged
      foliage at the end of the warm season and sprouts anew in the spring. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      3&lt;/a&gt; image, and it too faces generally eastward from the Persimmon Gap
      Road. Refer to the Part 3 description for a preliminary discussion of this huge
      rockfall.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nMy simple legend for this simple diagram:\n\n1 = Lower
      Cretaceous Santa Elena Limestone\n\n2 = Upper Cretaceous Del Rio Clay\n\nred
      line = Santiago Thrust Fault (Upper Cretaceous or Tertiary)\n\n\n&lt;b&gt;Here&#039;s
      what happened, when:&lt;/b&gt;\n\nA. First, the Santa Elena formed on the ocean
      floor between the diverging North and South American continents as the breakup
      of Pangaea proceeded.\n\nB. Millions of years later, the Del Rio, an assortment
      of claystone, limestone, and sandstone beds, was deposited in part by pulses
      of clastic sediments transported from land to the north. \n\nC. After that,
      the Laramide Orogeny: crustal compression, caused by the oceanic Farallon Plate
      shallowly underriding the western side of the North American Plate, triggered
      countless low-angle thrust faults. These included the Santiago, shown here and
      in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53075964779/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      2&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nD.  During the formation of the Santiago Thrust Fault, the
      older Santa Elena was folded up over the younger Del Rio.\n\nE.  In AD 1987,
      weathering and slope erosion of the relatively soft Del Rio undermined the Santa
      Elena strata above it, till the latter broke free. And kawoosh and kaboom.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      at long last the Sun is shining, and it brightens the residual mist of the recent
      rain. The milky luminescence of the foggy background gives the stonework in
      the foreground a rather somber, ghostly aspect. And at right there is indeed
      one ghost, young and American, peering down into the abyss.\n\nClose-ups of
      this famous burial ground follow, but even here, at this range, you can easily
      distinguish the ancient city&#039;s two great building-stone types. \n\nThe
      very coarse-textured but clean-cutting Mycenae Conglomerate is most obvious
      in the grave circle&#039;s upright slabs and in the mini-labyrinth structure
      at the entrance. It&#039;s merely Pliocene to Pleistocene in age, and was quarried
      in the Argos Graben valley below.\n\nIn contrast, the masonry of the circle&#039;s

      height_l=\"695\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Facing northwestward,
      at the church&#039;s southeastern quarter. So I&#039;ve moved about 45 degrees
      clockwise from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53090184813/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      1 image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nPartially visible at middle right is the Agora&#039;s
      ineffable, Doric-order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52675247306/in/album-721777203026&quot;&gt;Temple
      of Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;. And just above it, continuing horizontally across the
      frame, is the darker ridge of Mount Egaleo. Between the heydays of the temple
      and the church, what a difference in world views and architectural styles .
      . . \n\nThis shot also better reveals what I take to be the Megara Limestone
      ashlar&#039;s shelly (i. e., super-fossiliferous) texture. I infer from various
      snippets in various sources that these shells belong to a once-thriving, Pliocene-epoch
      community of lamellibranch bivalves and gastropods. \n\nAnd then there&#039;s
      that absolutely classic Middle Byzantine cloisonn\xE9 masonry style, here often
      involving course spacers of two wafer-thin bricks instead of just one. In places
      it looks as though some impromptu rubbly patchwork repais have been necessary.\n\nFinally,
      that wonderful, fired-clay roof tile\u2014terra-cotta manufactured from local
      Attic clays. Note the two different types used: the half-tubular &lt;i&gt;kalupter&lt;/i&gt;
      form, and the flat &lt;i&gt;solenes&lt;/i&gt;. This utilization of a pair of
      alternating shapes, set in an imbricated (overlapping) pattern, was first developed
      by the ancient Greeks. It&#039;s still in use today, even in barbarian realms
      beyond the Pillars of Hercules. \n\nAh, so much pleasing detail, so much geology,
      in such a small package.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      section of dressed-face and polished Waupaca Granite cladding flanking the Chapel&#039;s
      entrance&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nThis photo is the companion of, and a subtle contrast
      to, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53087844015/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      8&lt;/a&gt;, where the &amp;quot;Red&amp;quot; variety of Waupaca Granite is
      shown. This is the type marketed instead as &amp;quot;Gray.&amp;quot;\n\nIn
      fact, even here the black ferromagnesian minerals biotite and hornblende have
      been altered a little bit into greenish epidote and chlorite, but overall this
      panel retains more of the rock&#039;s original composition and coloration than
      the one described in Part 8. This is more obvious when you actually stand at
      the Chapel entrance and see both of them together.\n\nIn this shot, there&#039;s
      some very fine evidence of the stone&#039;s rapakivi texture: white-plagioclase
      mantling of the big red alkali-feldspar crystals. For more on the origin of
      this striking granite, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53025072282/in/album-72177720302670513/&quot;&gt;Part

      and big eroded slope of Monte di Rivo from the lower lookout point.\n\nIt&#039;s
      interesting to observe how after a huge landslide from some 10.000 years ago
      even nowadays big rock towers are being created. The slope behind (of Monte
      Cucco) is already stabilised.</description>\n\t</photo>\n\t<photo id=\"53102669462\"

      on the southern side of the church&#039;s eastern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nGenuine
      CCB (Cream City Brick), up close and personal. The pale stone just barely visible
      below it is Chicagoland&#039;s own Lemont-Joliet Dolostone. It forms the building&#039;s
      base.\n\nCCB, the famous product of Milwaukee&#039;s claypits, came in many
      different forms. If you tour the great town of its origin, you&#039;ll soon
      discover buildings clad in everything from aristocratic, whitish-yellow facing
      brick of the highest quality and durability to pebbly common brick with a palette
      ranging from the characteristic cream tint seen here to peach, salmon, brown,
      and even green, believe it or not. \n\nBut the classic color you see here, so
      strikingly different than that of ruddy-red and orange types made in Philadelphia,
      Baltimore, and St. Louis, can be traced back to the unique geochemistry of its
      base material.\n\nThe redness typical of most American brick is due to the oxidation
      of its clay&#039;s iron content when fired in the kiln. But the Cream City&#039;s
      clays, lacustrine and fluviatile sediments deposited in the valleys of its three
      major streams, are mostly derived from unusually calcium-and magnesium-rich
      glacial till dumped in that region by the last of the Pleistocene ice sheets.
      In turn, that till&#039;s composition owes much to the Silurian and Devonian
      dolostone bedrock of eastern Wisconsin that had been incorporated into it.\n\nActually,
      Milwaukee&#039;s clays contain as much iron as any other, but their Ca/Mg content
      is on average up to 15 times as great. When fired, the latter elements mask
      the iron-oxide color and produce white to pale yellow tones instead. \n\nInterestingly,
      the brick here at Old St. Pat&#039;s appears to be a less costly, common variety\u2014as
      evidenced by its pebble content (and by the pits where pebbles used to be).
      Most of the small surviving rock fragments have blackened. This is a common
      artifact of chert and other rock types long exposed to urban air pollution.
      \ \n\nMost of the pits originally contained bits of dolostone. On firing, this
      carbonate rock type combusts, sometimes with a loud popping sound, into crumbly
      lime that soon disintegrates.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this site, see my book

      self was trying to be artsy when I took this oblique view of the church&#039;s
      southern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe quality of this old slide transfer does
      not permit me to identify all the members of the menagerie that inhabits the
      column capitals. But their number includes birds and what appears to be a cross
      between a weasal and a giant slug. And there is also a very Romanesque take
      on sphinxes (human heads, lion bodies, eagle wings). Long gone is the formulistic
      formalism of the Greco-Roman architecture. \n\nFrom cornice to the bases of
      the doubled columns, the stone appears to uniformly be the locally quarried,
      Upper Cretaceous Segovia Sandstone. But the big ashlar blocks of the plinth
      below have the pinkish-gray tint and coarsely crystalline texture of the other
      great regional rock type, the Upper Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) Guadarrama
      Granite. \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this series,

      stonemasons were of a whimsical sort. Either that, or they bore the architect
      a grudge, because they delighted in placing fieldstone boulders in such a way
      they projected well into the windows&#039; fields of view. Or again, perhaps
      this feature is a defensive measure against marauding Episcopalians.\n\nIn any
      case, it&#039;s a wonderfully eccentric touch.\n\nFrom this shot it&#039;s also
      clear that not all the dark-toned glacial erratics used here are actually mafic
      Keweenawan basalt. Instead, quite a few are felsic granitoids or gneisses derived
      from them. These normally lighter-colored stones have for some reason collected
      more soot than their companIons. \n\nThis means I can engage in some additional
      terminological humbuggery for my newly invented field of Soot Science: these
      grime-covered rocks are &lt;i&gt;fuligaceous cryptogranitoid pseudobasalts.&lt;/i&gt;
      Yee-haw. That&#039;s damned impressive.\n\nIncidentally, the cream-colored,
      dressed-face rock of the sill and trim is Lemont-Joliet Dolostone, Silurian
      in age. It was quarried southwest of Chicago, in the Lower Des Plaines River
      Valley. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this site, see my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago in

      portion of the entranceway of the building&#039;s eastern, lake-facing, South
      Michigan Avenue elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\n So here at last we have a close-in
      view of the white-glazed terra-cotta sections manufactured from Pennsylvanian
      (Upper Carboniferous) underclays and shales by Chicago&#039;s own Northwestern
      works.\n\nLike ashlar blocks, they are set between joints of mortar, but unlike
      them they&#039;re fireproof, remarkably light in weight, and secured at the
      back with metal fasteners. And because they could be molded in exquisite detail
      by Northwestern&#039;s staff of master craftsmen, the cladding units embodied
      even the wildest flights of a designer&#039;s fancy.\n\nThe light weight ensured
      that terra-cotta sections were easier to manipulate and less costly to ship.
      And, as noted in Part 1, they could be cleaned much more easily\u2014a fact
      that made the erection of white skyscrapers in the Age of Bituminous Coal Burning
      much less of a folly to propose to image-conscious developers.\n\nBut while
      turn-of-the-century architects had all sorts of reasons for preferring terra-cotta
      to rock, the fact remains that no material mounted on a building exterior in
      a continental climate can be expected to survive the onslaught of precipitation,
      air pollution, and temperature extremes for more than a few fleeting decades.
      \n\nThis point can be easily ascertained if you scrutinize this image under
      high magnification. You&#039;ll find plenty of places where the very thin layer
      of ceramic glaze has chipped or spalled away to reveal the &lt;i&gt;bisque&lt;/i&gt;,
      the fired-clay base material.   \n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this site, see my book

      1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; \n\nThis is my quintesssential Cumberland Plateau shot:
      copious amounts of uplifted but still essentially flat-bedded Pennsylvanian
      (Upper Carboniferous) sandstone, highly dissected into cliffs and escarpments;
      forest stretching in all directions. \n\nOn this upper surface of the state
      park&#039;s natural arch, the Corbin Sandstone has weathered and spalled unevenly
      to produce some high spots and others that make splendid natural birdbaths holding
      rainwater long after the latest passing shower.\n\nIn the central ground stands
      another fine exposure of the Corbin Member of the Grundy Formation. Its strata
      supposedly contain some possible channel-scour structures, but in this leafy
      season I wasn&#039;t able to spot them.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos

      at the church&#039;s  northern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis ample expanse of
      locally quarried rock ashlar, set in an unusual coursed pattern of two thin
      blocks stacked between single thick ones, is made of the same Ordovician St.
      Peter Sandstone seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52411715473/in/album-72177720302395101/&quot;&gt;Part
      4 of this set&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nFor years, most of my experience with the St. Peter
      was in outcrops along the Prairie State&#039;s Illinois and Fox Rivers, where
      it tends to be softer, crumblier, whiter, and less tinted with such cementing
      iron-oxide compounds as goethite and hematite. \n\nBut here, in the southwestern
      reaches of the Badger State, those accessory minerals put on a much better show.
      They stain the rock yellow, ocher, and chocolate, and often glue its frosted
      quartz grains sufficiently to make it a decent dimension stone. And in the Darlington/Red
      Rock areas, about 14 road mi (22.5 km) south of Mineral Point, the St. Pete
      is downright purple to maroon. It could easily be mistaken for a Lake Superior
      Brownstone variety. \n\nThat&#039;s quite a palette and hardness range for any
      one rock type.   \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this

      from the nave toward the inner and outer nathexes and the church&#039;s main
      portal.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nOf the various slides I took of Chora&#039;s interior,
      this is the only one decently salvageable after forty-eight years. Given the
      immense artistic and geologic significance of the place, this is more than just
      regrettable. \n\nBut even when crisp detail and an eye-catching angle are missing
      from this image, there&#039;s a lot of interesting information to eluct. For
      one thing, the photo correctly suggests that the building&#039;s interior is
      bathed in natural light. In fact, I can recall no other church, mosque, or synagogue
      I&#039;ve been in that collects photons from our local G-type star quite as
      efficiently.  \n\nFor another, while this shot does little justice to the great
      \ Dormition of the Theotokos (Death of the Mother of God) mosaic above the doorway,
      it gives a fair indication of the riot of fancy stone cladding the building
      contains.\n\nThe dominant rock type featured here is the flamboyant Iasian Marble,
      known to Italian &lt;i&gt;scalpellini&lt;/i&gt; (stonecutters) as &amp;quot;Cipollino
      Rosso&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Rosso Antico.&amp;quot; Various anglophone archaeologists
      and architectural historians have called it by other names, too\u2014&amp;quot;Carian
      Marble,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Mu\u011Fla Marble,&amp;quot; and so forth. The last
      of these refers to the province in Asiatic Turkey where it was and apparently
      still is quarried..\n\nOne of the persistent problems of researching famous
      but underdescribed stone types of the ancient world is determining their ages.
      Even detailed bedrock maps are of little use in that regard if exact quarrying
      sites aren&#039;t known. And this is the case with the Iasian. Apparently it&#039;s
      a true calcitic marble, and a highly folded and contorted one at that. But I
      have yet to see the chronologies or formational environments of its protolith
      or metamorphosed form cited in the professional geologic literature. \n\nExactly
      how many of the panels on view here are Iasian, I&#039;m not sure. But those
      that sport a combination of deep-red and cream-colored zones definitely are.
      Often they are set in &lt;i&gt; book matches&lt;/i&gt;, with two slabs cut from
      the same section of patterned rock laid opposite to one another, to produce
      a symmetrical pattern. This decorative technique predates the Byzantines, and
      is still employed today.\n\nThe Iasian&#039;s lurid red tinting is due to the
      presence of the accessory mineral hematite. Silvery-gray graphite is also sometimes
      visible. \n\nIt may be much less attention-grabbing, but the pale ashlar of
      the upper level is probably locally extracted Bak\u0131rk\xF6y Limestone. At
      least &lt;i&gt;its&lt;/i&gt; age is well-known; it dates to the Miocene epoch.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      the entrance is on the church&#039;s southern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe bright,
      clear light of a winter cold-front day highlights the church&#039;s Chequamegon
      Sandstone. This Lake Superior Brownstone variety is a common sight in Milwaukee,
      but nowhere else in the Cream City does it demonstrate its potential as a carving
      stone that holds crisp detail for decades.\n\nThe stone here, quarried on Basswood
      Island in the Apostles archipelago, formed from sand and pebbles eroded from
      highland areas bordering the Midcontinent Rift. For more on its geology and
      the uncertanty of its age, take a look at Part 14. \n\nSo far I haven&#039;t
      been able to definitively identify the light-pink granitoid pillar shafts flanking
      the doorway. Very often, nineteenth-century Milwaukee architects used selections
      of Scotland&#039;s Aberdeenshire Granite for this application, but in this case
      I&#039;m just not sure. \n\n&lt;b&gt;This site, and many others in Milwaukee
      County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53241541841/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;

      less eastward at the Santiago Mountains. Taken from the side of the Persimmon
      Gap Road. We&#039;re about 3.2 road mi (5.1 km) southeast of the Persimmon Gap
      Visitor Center, and just to the northwest of Dog Canyon. &lt;/i&gt;\n\nEveryone
      driving between Persimmon Gap and Panther Junction notices this huge gash in
      the hillside, and the mega-boulders lying at its base. This is the scar of the
      great rockfall that occurred in 1987. The rumbling the landslide generated was
      loud enough to be heard at the ranger station cited above.\n\nAs I write this
      I realize that to clearly explain why the rock unit on top of the escarpment
      broke away, I&#039;m going to have to do an annotated version of this photo,
      too. \n\nFor now, suffice it to say that the Santiago Thrust Fault, shown in
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53075964779/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;the
      previous image and description&lt;/a&gt;, is present here as well. Above it
      is the hard, older (Lower Cretaceous) Santa Elena Limestone. Below are younger
      (Upper Cretaceous) formations, including the soft, crumbly, and generally wimpy
      Del Rio Clay. The Del Rio weathers and erodes easily, and in this locale it
      eventually undermined the Santa Elena so much that the latter took a nosedive
      down the slope.\n\nAnd that&#039;s right\u2014once again, we have a flipped
      layercake, with an older mass of rock sitting atop a younger. To a Midwestern
      geologist, this just ain&#039;t natural.  \n\n(Later note: if you happen to
      spot a line of strange white objects hovering in an evenly spaced formation
      over the mountains, don&#039;t be alarmed. It&#039;s just a fleet of UFOs from
      the Episilon Eridani star system scouting out the site for a new intergalactic
      theme park. Either that, or the dots are warning markers, presumably for low-flying,
      human-type aircraft, set on the telephone wire that parallels the road. But
      I don&#039;t see any telephone poles in this locale on Google Earth Steet View.
      So either they&#039;ve been removed since 2002 or . . . &lt;i&gt;we are not
      alone&lt;/i&gt;.) \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this

      at a group of wanderers from a distant land hanging on their tour guide&#039;s
      every word. Or at least some of them are.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nDating to the sixteenth
      century BC, Grave Circle A predates the final phases of Mycenae&#039;s citadel
      construction by approximately three hundred years. In fact, it was situated
      outside the city&#039;s walls until the battlements were expanded to their maximum
      extent in about 1250 and 1225 BC.\n\nThis great circular enclosure, 27.5 m (90
      ft) in diameter, is famous for its six shaft graves, which were first excavated
      in the nineteenth century by Heinrich Schliemann. Nowadays this businessman-turned-archaeological-enthusiast
      is considered by some field workers, trained in the methods of meticulousness,
      to have been archaeology&#039;s answer to Attila the Hun. In his media-hyped
      expeditions there was much that he found, and much more that he could have,
      but obliterated in his monomaniacal quest for direct evidence of Homeric heroes.\n\nWhatever
      the collateral damage, Schliemann did extract from this burial-in-the-round
      site such famous artifacts as the beaten-gold death mask of a local notable
      he incorrectly supposed to the Agamemnon, the legendary Mycenaean king and commander
      of the Greek forces in the Trojan War.\n\nTo the architectural geologist, Grave
      Circle A is a lovely place to look at Bronze Age masonry up close, and in my
      succeeding photos we&#039;ll do just that. Not surprisingly, both the Triassic-to-Jurassic
      Mycenae Limestone and the Pliocene-to Pleistocene Mycenae Conglomerate are on
      ample display.  \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions of this

      toward the church&#039;s apse and eastern elevation&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nCaught in
      the fading light of sunset, this modestly proportioned church sits among various
      excavated fragments of more ancient times. After checking on Google Earth, I
      note that most of this site&#039;s archaeological spoils, including the open-faced,
      bilevel storage shed at lower left, are still here half a century later.\n\nHoly
      Apostles is the best place to start an architectural-geology exploration of
      Byzantine Athens. For one thing, this is the city&#039;s oldest surviving church
      from the fascinating though sometimes overlooked Middle phase of the Eastern
      Roman Empire, For another, it demonstrates classic construction techniques and
      materials of that era that we&#039;ll see on other houses of worship located
      in the Greek capital&#039;s bustling heart and residential neighborhoods.\n\nIf
      by any chance you&#039;ve already seen my photo set on the monastery at Daphni
      (the best place to start is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52477735805/in/album-72177720303792872/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;),
      you&#039;ll know that Holy Apostles shares with it a very distinctive masonry
      style known as &lt;i&gt;cloisonn\xE9&lt;/i&gt;. Dressed-face ashlar blocks of
      what archaeolgists call with frustrating vagueness &amp;quot;Poros&amp;quot;
      limestone are separated by wafer-thin, single or paired bricks. This produces
      a richly textured effect that better relates the buff-colored stone below to
      the red roofing tile above.\n\nAs to the exact identity of the church&#039;s
      &amp;quot;Poros,&amp;quot; fortunately there is one academic archaeological
      treatise that mentions it \u2014as being &amp;quot;chiefly the characteristic
      Megarian stone which contains a large quantity of sea shells.&amp;quot; (Franz,
      Alison. &lt;i&gt;The Church of the Holy Apostles.&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 20, The Athenian
      Agora. Princeton, NJ: The American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1971.)\n\nIf
      this reference is accurate, it&#039;s my first documented example of this soft,
      workable carbonate rock from Megara, a community situated a geologic basin about
      halfway between Athens and the Isthmus of Corinth. Another paper, R. E. Wycherley&#039;s
      1974 &amp;quot;The Stones of Athens,&amp;quot; mentions in a footnote that &amp;quot;Poros&amp;quot;
      was produced in Megara occasionally. Perhaps it became a more important quarrying
      center in Medieval times. I just don&#039;t know. But in any case I&#039;m informally
      dubbing it the Megara Limestone. \n\nFrom these descriptions, I gather the Megara
      closely resembles the more common Piraeus Limestone, which also is chock full
      of &amp;quot;sea shells&amp;quot; (specifically lamellibranch bivalves and gastropods).
      While it&#039;s a rather generalized view of the Megara region, the EuroGeoSurveys
      EGDI online bedrock map suggests that the Megara Limestone, like the Piraeus,
      is Pliocene in age.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in

      a geomorphological point of view, it represents a residual ridge that has been

      and polished Waupaca Granite cladding flanking the Chapel&#039;s entrance&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nOnce
      again I&#039;ve engaged the services of one of the Midwest&#039;s finest semiprofessional
      male hand models (i. e., yours truly) to provide scale. From middle fingertip
      to wrist = 9 in = 23 cm.\n\nHere the nature of the Waupaca as a &lt;i&gt;rapakivi
      granite&lt;/i&gt; is finally revealed. Many of its beauteously big pink-to-red
      alkali-feldspar crystals (probably mostly orthoclase, but some microcline is
      also possible) are mantled with thin to quite thick jackets of white plagioclase
      feldspar (most likely oligoclase).  \n\nThe polished stone on display is the
      &amp;quot;Red&amp;quot; variety marketed in the late nineteenth century by the
      short-lived Waupaca Granite Company. The striking greenish minerals that complement
      the feldspars are hornblende and biotite mica that have been altered into chlorite
      and epidote. \n\nRapakivis, often sought out by architects and interior designers
      for their ornamental appeal, usually fall into the category of what geologists
      call A-type granites\u2014that is, those that formed in &lt;i&gt;anorogenic&lt;/i&gt;
      environments where crustal compression, plate subduction, and mountain-building
      are not taking place. But recent research suggests that the Waupaca and other
      Wolf River Batholith (WRB) granites about 1.4 Ga old may owe their origin instead
      to an unusual episode of crustal crunching caused by mantle melting and the
      process of &lt;i&gt;continental underplating&lt;/i&gt;. Or, on the other hand,
      they might be the result of a very shallowly dipping plate remnant moving under
      that section of Laurentia. \n\nIf you&#039;re up for a more technical discussion
      of this reinterpretation of the WRB and its relationship to the Baraboo Interval/Orogeny,
      see this 2021 &lt;i&gt;Geoscience Frontiers&lt;/i&gt; paper: L. Gordon Medaris

      of Cream City Brick on the church&#039;s southern bell tower. For an overall
      view of this distinctive house of worship, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52363746112/in/album-72177720302658037/&quot;&gt;Part
      1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nAlso visible in this image is a window sill and other
      trim of Silurian-period Lemont-Joliet Dolostone, the city&#039;s most widely
      used variety of Chicagoland&#039;s native building stone. \n\nMilwaukeean friends
      of mine have the right to ask, &amp;quot;Why are you beginning your discussion
      of &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; famous brick by showing it used in &lt;i&gt;Chicago&lt;/i&gt;,
      the Evil City of the Flatlanders, of all places!?! This is outright heresy!
      We have scads of beautiful buildings made of the stuff! Why don&#039;t you feature
      them instead?&amp;quot;\n\nChill out, you Cheeseheads. I love Milwaukee and
      its brick and  buildings and geology so much I&#039;ve just written &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53241541841/in/album-72177720301296710/&quot;&gt;a
      whole book on the Cream City&lt;/a&gt; (NIU imprint of Cornell University Press,
      due out in spring of 2024). I just happened to start with Old St. Pat&#039;s
      because it was covered in my already-published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52286670650/in/album-72177720301296710/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chicago
      in Stone and Clay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (also see the publisher&#039;s link, below).
      And you should be proud that your brick has been used in so many places besides
      your own home town.\n\nI like this particular shot because it reveals both Cream
      City Brick&#039;s lovely pale-yellow tint and its propensity to show off its
      collected soot a little more overtly than most other building materials. \n\nAs
      I hope to eventially show, some of Milwaukee&#039;s most magnificent buildings
      (e.g., Old St. Mary&#039;s Catholic Church), are now  almost completely black
      rather than cream-colored, largely because they are survivors from the Age of
      Bituminous Coal Burning. But, as I write in my forthcoming tome, I&#039;m an
      unrepentant &lt;i&gt;fuligophile&lt;/i&gt; (grime aesthete) who has the brazen
      temerity to actually like the brick that way. And I like the dark highlights
      (lowlights?) on the St. Pat&#039;s facade, too. That moderate amount of gunk
      adds character. I hope no misguided restorationists ever try to clean it off.
      \n\nThe next photo in this set will show the Cream City Brick here at close
      range. That will be the perfect time to discuss its glacial and fluviatile origins
      in Milwaukee&#039;s river valleys.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this site, see my

      and looking at the northern elevation.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nWhen it comes to arcaded
      porches, San Mart\xEDn outdoes all of Segovia&#039;s other Romaneque churches
      in having them on three sides instead of just one or two. But if you compare
      this photo with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53042100663/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      14 of the set&lt;/a&gt;, which shows San Esteban, you might be a bit confused
      which building is which. \n\nBoth of these venerable houses of worship have
      double-columned, semicircular arches, a plinth of pinkish-gray stone I take
      to be this region&#039;s Upper Carboniferous Guadarrama Granite, and ashlar
      and carved ornament higher up fashioned from the locally quarried, Upper Cretaceous
      Segovia Sandstone. And, of course, a quintessentially Spanish-style terra-cotta
      tile roof.  \n\nBut here at San Mart\xEDn, the &lt;i&gt;voussoirs&lt;/i&gt;
      (wedge-shaped stones that form the arches) are quite simple in design; at San
      Esteban they&#039;re more elaborately decorated. Still, both churches have highly
      sculpted column capitals well worth your scrutiny: they variously feature geometric
      basket patterns, whimsical creatures, and religious mini-dramas played out by
      an assortment of human figures. \n\nOne other difference, I think, is in San
      Mart\xEDn&#039;s varying column-shaft composition. Some are granite, it appears,
      and some are sandstone. Perhaps a few had to be replaced over the centuries,
      and the original rock type was not readily available?\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the

      facing eastward and zooming in on the exterior&#039;s big stones themselves,
      and on the contrasting buff-colored stringcourse.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nI call the church&#039;s
      style &amp;quot;Fieldstone on Steroids&amp;quot; because the quirky covering
      of boulders pretty much overwhelms what I suspect was the building&#039;s originally
      tidier and un-Mannerist design. Whether or not my suspicions are correct, the
      whole project gives the impression of having grown like mutating epidermal tissue
      out of the architect&#039;s control. Just look at those bulky and bristling
      buttresses, for instance.\n\nThe Epworth Church&#039;s dark and brooding aspect
      is largely due to the fact that a hefty portion of its bargeload of boulders
      consists of Stygian-black basalt shipped, so it appears, straight from Mount
      Doom in the kingdom of Mordor.\n\nIn other words, what&#039;s not to love? \n\nAnd
      incidentally, the reference to Sauron&#039;s realm isn&#039;t all that out of
      place. The basalt first congealed from mafic lava in a very Mordoresque environment\u2014the
      faulted, fuming, and hypervolcanic landscape of the Midcontinent Rift (MCR).
      This great horseshoe-shaped tear in the Earth&#039;s crust, which runs through
      the Lake Superior basin and the heart of North America, formed about 1.1 Ga
      ago, at the end of the Mesoproterozoic era.\n\nIn it erupted a vast succession
      of flood-basalt flows. The black rocks visible in this shot probably come from
      the section of the MCR that is now a part of Upper Michigan&#039;s Keweenaw
      Peninsula. Only much later were they ripped from outcrops there and transported
      southward by the Wisconsin icesheet.\n\nRegarding the stringcourse, it&#039;s
      mostly much younger, Silurian- period Lemont-Joliet Dolostone. However, that
      rock type was no longer commercially available in 1930 when an addition to the
      church&#039;s front was built. So for that portion of the structure  concrete,
      carefully tinted to match the dolostone, was used instead. But I think everything
      on view here is the genuine Lemont-Joliet article.\n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this

      northern end of the skylighted atrium of this Beaux-Arts beauty.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nAs
      noted in this set&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52299667909/in/album-72177720302670488/&quot;&gt;Part
      1&lt;/a&gt;, the exterior of the Railway Exchange Building is one one the Windy
      City&#039;s showplaces of gleaming white terra-cotta cladding. But the building&#039;s
      interior is even more impressive. \n\nHere the custom-molded, fired, and glazed
      clay sections manufactured by the city&#039;s own Northwestern works are cream-colored
      and used as cladding for many of the major architectural elements of the ground
      floor and mezzanine  besides the floor pavers and stair treads and risers. For
      those, a chaste-white true marble (its exact type was apparently not documented)
      was employed. The two materials complement each other wonderfully.\n\nAs also
      noted in Part 1 (see link above), the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company obtained
      most of its base material from Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) underclay
      paleosols and marine shales shipped in by rail from the Illinois Basin coal-mining
      district. \n\n&lt;b&gt;For more on this site, see my book &lt;i&gt;Chicago in

      &lt;i&gt;pedigenic abrasion&lt;/i&gt;, first brilliantly revealed to the scientific
      world in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52640820781/in/album-72177720302395234/&quot;&gt;this
      groundbreaking Flickr treatise&lt;/a&gt;, has swept like an ideational wildfire
      through the professional geological community.  \n\nBut if you&#039;re one of
      those poor sods who&#039;s behind the times and who hasn&#039;t completely committed
      this paradigm-shifter to memory, pedigenic abrasion is an utterly pompous and
      unnecessary Latin-based term for &lt;i&gt;foot wear by footwear&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nAnd
      let&#039;s face it. As we gaze across the upper surface of the natural-bridge-that&#039;s-really-a-natural-arch-instead
      we note that the Corbin Sandstone Member of the Lower Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous)
      Grundy Formation has patiently suffered the buffing effects of countless hominid
      pedal extremities. One recently published PhD thesis suggests that 86% of them
      were clad in Birkenstock hiking sandals.  \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos

      a glass vase or figurine fall to the ground and shatter, you&#039;ve probably
      noticed that its broken pieces formed curved rather than flat surfaces. This
      property, known to geologists as &lt;i&gt;conchoidal fracture&lt;/i&gt;, is
      the result of the glass&#039;s high silica (quartz) content. Such quartz-rich
      rocks as chert also exhibit conchoidal fracture.\n\nThe rock on display here
      at Rountree Hall isn&#039;t chert, though it certainly looks like it. Instead,
      it&#039;s the Ordovician-period Quimbys Mill Member limestone. (If you&#039;re
      a grammarian who&#039;s wondering why it isn&#039;t &amp;quot;Quimby&#039;s&amp;quot;
      instead, you&#039;ll have to ask the US and Wisconsin geological surveys, whose
      stratigraphers officially list it that way. They may have been taking their
      lead from the US Post Office, which in the early twentieth century was hell-bent
      on removing possessive-case apostrophes from American place names.) \n\nBadger
      state quarriers and miners nicknamed the Quimbys Mill &amp;quot;Glass Rock&amp;quot;
      because it, too, can form conchoidal surfaces when cracked apart. On this image
      that trait is most evident almost smack-dab in the center, where one ashlar
      block has an almost circular, scooped-out zone right in the middle. But you&#039;ll
      soon spot other curved fractures as well. \n\nHowever, the funny thing is that
      the Quimbys Mill, being a true limestone, is rich not in really hard quartz
      (Mohs Hardness Scale rating of 7)  but in quite-soft calcite (Mohs rating of
      just 3). This fact can be demonstrated by putting a few drops of dilute hydrochloric
      acid on a fresh surface. Believe me, it fizzes like crazy, as effervescence
      proceeds and carbon dioxide gas is liberated from the calcium carbonate of the
      calcite. (&lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt; do not do this at Rountree Hall. Go find
      a legally accessible outcrop of this rock in the Platteville area and try it
      there. Or hire an indigent UW-Platteville geology major to get you a specimen.)
      \n\nThere&#039;s something about the microcrystalline structure of the calcite
      in this particular limestone that encourages it to break the way chert does.
      No doubt there&#039;s some geochemist out there in Flickrland who could explain
      it in greater detail than I currently can.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos

      to Aurora, Northeastern Illinois&#039; Fox River Valley boasts its own important
      architectural legacy featuring both locally quarried Regional Silurian Dolostone
      (RSD) and its own brands of peachy-yellow to red brick.\n\nIn the case of this
      simple but lovingly restored old building, we focus on the RSD, and the variety
      thereof I call the Fox Valley Dolostone. In the nineteenth century this striking
      rock type, taken from the thin-bedded Sugar Run Formation, was quarried from
      the Fox&#039;s bluffs, floodplain, banks, and even the river bed in places.\n\nOf
      all the Silurian-period formations used for building materials in northen Illinois
      and eastern Wisconsin, it&#039;s the Sugar Run that usually weathers most extensively
      from its original blue-gray tint to buttery-yellow and ocher tones. When it
      does so extensively, as on the Holbrook Mill, it produces a warmhearted and
      cheerful aspect noticeably absent in such competing stone types as southern
      Indiana&#039;s drably gray Salem (&amp;quot;Bedford&amp;quot;) Limestone. (See
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52299633795/in/album-72177720302400187/&quot;&gt;Part
      24&lt;/a&gt; for a closer look at the Fox Valley Dolostone used on the Holbrook
      exterior.)   \n\nThe Regional Silurian Dolostones formed some 425 Ma ago, in
      shallow, reef-studded subtropical waters and on a narrow upwarped section of
      continental crust geologists call the Kankakee Arch. This structure was situated
      between the deeper waters of the Illinois and Michigan Basins, at a time when
      the American Midwest was situated approximately 30 degrees south of the equator.\n\n&lt;b&gt;You&#039;ll

      1&lt;/a&gt; of this set, which shows Persimmon Peak in all its nekkid glory&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nFirst
      of all, I want to stress that this crude diagram, my own work, is based on at
      least somewhat more professionally rendered versions in sources I&#039;ve consulted
      over the years. One of these is found in a favorite geology guidebook of mine,
      William MacLeod&#039;s highly recommended &lt;i&gt;Big Bend Vistas: Journeys
      through Big Bend National Park&lt;/i&gt; (3rd ed.; Fort Worth: TCU Press, 2017).
      Another important and presumably up-to-date resource for this site is the US
      Geological Survey&#039;s 2011 bedrock map of the park (Scientific Investigations
      Map 3142) and its accompanying &amp;quot;pamphlet&amp;quot; (at 84 pages, more
      like a booklet).   \n\nThe numbers on the image represent Persimmon Peak&#039;s
      different stratigraphic units, with 1 being the oldest and 4 the youngest. They
      are:\n\n1 = A unit formerly mapped just as the Ordovician Maravillas Formation,
      but on the 2011 USGS map listed as &amp;quot;Mississippian to Ordovician Rocks,
      Undivided.&amp;quot; (Alternating limestone and chert.)\n\n2 = The Mississippian
      to Pennsylvanian (Carboniferous) Tesnus Formation. (Shale, siltstone, sandstone.)\n\n3
      = The Lower Cretaceous Glen Rose Limestone. \n\n4 = The Upper Cretaceous Pen
      Formation. (Claystone and sandstone.)\n\nOriginally, all these units were deposited
      horizontally, but two major thrust-faulting events associated with crustal compression
      and mountain building have produced all the topsy-flopsiness on display here.
      \n\n&lt;b&gt;Here&#039;s my synopsis of what happened, when:&lt;/b&gt;\n\nA.
      First, the Maravillas/Undivided Ordovician-Mississippian (1) was deposited on
      the ocean bottom off the margin of Laurussia, a large landmass that included
      ancestral North America. Later, the Tesnus (2) was also deposited in the ocean
      closer to land, not long before or during B.\n\nB. Late in the Paleozoic era,
      during the assembly of Pangaea, the South American portion of the supercontinent
      Gondwana converged with Laurussia. This caused the first thrust fault visible
      here (roughly where the orange line is). The older Maravillas, etc. (1) was
      pushed northwestward, up and over the younger Tesnus (2). From this vantagepoint,
      the direction of thrusting was basically toward the observer. \n\nThis activity
      was part of the Ouachita (or Marathon) Orogeny, the southwesternmost extension
      of the Alleghenian (Appalachian) Orogeny, eastern North America&#039;s greatest
      mountain-building episode. \n\nC. When Pangaea broke up in this region late
      in the Mesozoic, a new ocean bottom formed. Lime muds of the Glen Rose (3) were
      deposited there, over the deformed older formations already mentioned.\n\nD.
      In the late Cretaceous the Pen Formation (4) was deposited. \n\nE. Not long
      after that, in the even-later Cretaceous and early Tertiary, the Glen Rose and
      the older, deformed formations (1-3) were pushed over the Pen (4) along the
      red line (it&#039;s called the Santiago Thrust Fault, the upper portion of which
      moved to the right). \n\nThis second great pulse of deformation resulted in
      Persimmon Peak&#039;s arrowhead-shaped bends, or &lt;i&gt;chevron folds&lt;/i&gt;,
      pointing to the right. (Flip back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53059715221/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      1&lt;/a&gt; to see them more clearly.) This warping of strata was a result of
      a new spate of crustal compression that occurred during western North America&#039;s
      great Laramide Orogeny. \n\nWhew. That took some effort to unpack. But it was
      worth it: this locale is one of those special places in the Trans-Pecos Texas
      where you can see direct evidence of mountain building from both sides of the
      continent.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions in this set

      height_l=\"684\" width_l=\"1024\">\n\t\t<description>&lt;i&gt;Facing southeastward.
      The Lion Gate is at center left; above it rises Mount Zara.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThis
      actually is a companion shot to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52322614536/in/album-72177720303812060/&quot;&gt;Part
      3 of this set&lt;/a&gt;, which shows the walls a little to the left of this.
      \n\nI like this image especially because it positions the Late Bronze Age citadel
      between its natural foundation, the gray, Triassic-to-Jurassic Mycenae Limestone
      bedrock, and the looming bulk of Mount Zara, made of the same stone unit. All
      the human constructive effort represented here\u2014all the animal and human
      muscle, and all the sawing, splitting, chiseling, pushing, pulling, and hoisting\u2014sits
      narrowly sandwiched between greater masses of carbonate rock, produced naturally
      in the slow flow of geologic time. \n\nThe monstrous blocks of Mycenae Conglomerate
      on display in the walls were laboriously hauled up from the valley of the Argos
      Graben. This coarse-textured stone dates only to the Pliocene and Pleistocene
      epochs, but it was chosen by Mycenae&#039;s builders because, as is obvious
      here thirty-four centuries later, it&#039;s a first-rate structural material
      that lasts. And lasts. And lasts.\n\nBut even this tough customer shows some
      signs of exposure to the elements. Besides its yellow iron-oxide staining, at
      least some of its giant blocks are in the first stage of &lt;i&gt;spheroidal
      weathering.&lt;/i&gt;. This process gradully removes the outer rinds of stone
      and reduces any sharp edges to rounded corners. I&#039;m not sure how crisply
      edged the Mycenaean masons&#039; conglomerate sections originally were, but
      it&#039;s safe to say that some are now rounder than they had been. Some also
      have cavities and broken corners. \n\nSpheroidal weathering is also commonly
      encountered in granitoid rocks\u2014for example, the similarly hefty blocks
      of Guadarrama Granite used about 1,300 years later in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52875633471/in/album-72177720307451632/&quot;&gt;Spain&#039;s
      Segovia Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt;.  \n\n&lt;b&gt;To see the other photos and descriptions

      with the Mount Hymettus ridgeline in the background.&lt;/i&gt;\n\nHere&#039;s
      one last angle on the surviving portion of this once-grandiose temple, erected
      during the reign of Rome&#039;s architect-emperor, Publius Aelius Hadrianus.
      He&#039;s better known to us barbaric anglophones as Hadrian.\n\nThe various
      sources I&#039;ve consulted agree, unsurprisingly, that the surviving columns
      are made of the gleaming white Pentelic Marble quarried on nearby Mount Pentelicus.
      At least it&#039;s white when not given the tints of yellowed ivory by the light
      of the late-afternoon Sun. Originally limestone of Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic
      age, it was metamorphosed into its present form in the Late Cretaceous to Tertiary.\n\nThe
      single reference I&#039;ve dug up so far that addresses the temple&#039;s much
      more ancient foundation states unequivocally that it&#039;s a bed of Pliocene-to-Pleistocene
      Kara Limestone, quarried over by the western flank of Hymettus. \n\nNow, so
      many years after my visit, I wish I knew what all those pebbles and cobbles
      on the ground are. Fragments of the Pentelic, broken off some shattered section
      of entablature? Kara, which once bore the weight of the massive superstructure
      and is now free to rise to the surface? Probably it&#039;s a mixture of both.\n\n&lt;b&gt;To

      away in its treesy setting, this Holabird &amp;amp; Roche gem is Chicago&#039;s
      best showplace of Wisconsin&#039;s Waupaca Granite. The fascinating origins
      of this coarse-textured, intrusive igneous rock are recounted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53025072282/in/dateposted-public/&quot;&gt;Part
      4 of this set&lt;/a&gt;. \n\nFor geologists, this small building is a must-see.
      While most of its exterior is made of rock-faced Waupaca ashlar, the steps and
      entrance are dressed-faced instead, and the stone&#039;s unusual &lt;i&gt;rapakivi&lt;/i&gt;
      texture can be discerned much more easily there. This is epecially true in the
      door surrounds, where the granite is also polished. \n\nThose particular features
      will be the focal points of the photos that follow!\n\n&lt;b&gt;To learn much
